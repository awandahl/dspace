These materials are fired at a temperature greater than 1000°C. Due to low sinterability during firing, quartz remains embedded in a glassy matrix. During cooling, a mismatch in the thermal expansion coefficient of quartz and its surrounding creates cracks as a result of residual stress. This study therefore explores the effect of quartz particle size on the magnitude of residual stress. The results are later compared with the mechanical behavior of the samples. Test samples were pressed at 40 MPa and then fired at a peak temperature of 1300°C at a rate of 60°C/min. Their microstructure was studied using a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The X-ray diffraction method was used to measure residual stress, calculation was based on [101] and [110] quartz planes. In addition, the measurement of flexural strength and hardness was limited to three point loading and Vickers indentation, respectively. The study revealed that the residual stress on quartz decreases with particle size over a range of 45–200 µm. The decrease was attributed to cracks formed in the microstructure of fired samples. The SEM micrograph of bodies with 45 µm showed a crack free glassy phase. As a result, a high value of flexural strength (33±1 MPa) and hardness (5.8±0.2 GPa) was exhibited by these samples. These results further point out that flexural strength is comparable to ISO 13006 standards of ≥ 35±2 MPa. The samples with 90 µm particle size exhibited strength of 25±1 MPa and hardness of 5.4 ± 0.1 GPa. Due to severe cracks triggered by residual stress effect, samples with 200 µm exhibited strength of 15±1 MPa and hardness of 4.6±0.1 GPa. Therefore, to minimize cracks due to stress effect, quartz size milling of less than 90 µm is encouraged.",,Scientific African,,,2021-03,2021,11,,e00648,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ochen, William; D'ujanga, Florence Mutonyi; Oruru, Bosco","Ochen, William (Physics Department, Kyambogo University, P.O Box 1, Kyambogo, Uganda; Physics Department, Makerere University, P.O Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda); D'ujanga, Florence Mutonyi (Physics Department, Makerere University, P.O Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda); Oruru, Bosco (Physics Department, Makerere University, P.O Box 7062, Kampala, Uganda)","Ochen, William (Kyambogo University; Makerere University)","Ochen, William (Kyambogo University; Makerere University); D'ujanga, Florence Mutonyi (Makerere University); Oruru, Bosco (Makerere University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2020.e00648,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133539740,0912 Materials Engineering; 09 Engineering,

We conducted a systematic meta-review of the published randomized control trial (RCT) evidence. MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycARTICLES and EMBASE were searched from inception to 06/2020 examining MBIs (mindfulness, qigong, tai chi, yoga) as add-on or monotherapy versus no treatment, minimal treatment and passive and active control conditions in people with a mental disorder. The quality of the methods of the included meta-analyses using A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) and the methodological quality of the RCTs using AMSTAR-Plus. Sixteen (94%) of 17 meta-analyses had good overall methodological quality. The content validity of the included RCTs was considered good in 9 (53%) meta-analyses. In meta-analyses with good methodological quality (AMSTAR 8≤) and content validity (AMSTAR+ 4≤), large effect sizes (0.80 or higher) were observed for mindfulness as add-on treatment in adults with schizophrenia spectrum and ADHD, and a moderate (0.50≤0.80) effect size for mindfulness as add-on treatment in PTSD. No serious adverse events were reported (n RCTs which assessed events=43, n in the MBI arms=1774), while the attrition rates were comparable with the rates in passive and active control conditions. Our meta-review demonstrates that mindfulness may serve as an efficacious supplement to pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and can be complementary in healthy lifestyle interventions for people with mental disorders. Meta-analytic evidence of high methodological quality and content validity of included trials is currently lacking for qigong, tai chi and yoga.","The authors would like to thank Melissa Eaton (Western Sydney University, Sydney, NSW, Australia) for her assistance in the data collection.",Journal of Psychiatric Research,,,2021-02,2021,134,,181-191,Closed,Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Stubbs, Brendon; Van Damme, Tine; Smith, Lee; Hallgren, Mats; Schuch, Felipe; Deenik, Jeroen; Rosenbaum, Simon; Ashdown-Franks, Garcia; Mugisha, James; Firth, Joseph","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium; University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, UK; Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, London, UK); Van Damme, Tine (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium); Smith, Lee (Cambridge Centre for Sport and Exercise Sciences, Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge, UK); Hallgren, Mats (Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Sweden); Schuch, Felipe (Department of Sports Methods and Techniques, Federal University of Santa Maria, Santa Maria, Brazil); Deenik, Jeroen (School for Mental Health and Neuroscience, Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands); Rosenbaum, Simon (School of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia); Ashdown-Franks, Garcia (Department of Exercise Sciences, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Mugisha, James (Department of Arts and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Firth, Joseph (NICM Health Research Institute, Western Sydney University, Westmead, Australia; Division of Psychology and Mental Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); Van Damme, Tine (KU Leuven); Smith, Lee (Anglia Ruskin University); Hallgren, Mats (Karolinska Institute); Schuch, Felipe (Federal University of Santa Maria); Deenik, Jeroen (Maastricht University); Rosenbaum, Simon (UNSW Sydney); Ashdown-Franks, Garcia (University of Toronto); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University); Firth, Joseph (Western Sydney University; University of Manchester)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133716660,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

The study adopted a cross–sectional research design to examine 64 MFIs in Uganda. Correlation and multiple regression analysis were performed to analyze the data. The results reveal that credit risk management significantly contributes to sound financial performance. Second, capital structure is not significantly related to financial performance. Therefore, credit risk appraisal, credit risk monitoring and credit risk mitigation are essential in achieving sound financial performance of MFIs. However, the structure of debt or equity does not necessarily affect financial performance. Hence, managers should endeavor to instill risk preventive and control mechanisms so as to mitigate credit risks and achieve positive financial performance of MFIs.   Key words: Agency theory, capital structure, credit risk management, financial performance, microfinance institutions.",,Journal of Economics and International Finance,,,2021-01-31,2021,13,1,24-31,All OA; Gold,Article,"Orichom, Geresem; Omeke, Michael","Orichom, Geresem (); Omeke, Michael ()",,"Orichom, Geresem (); Omeke, Michael ()",0,0,,,https://academicjournals.org/journal/JEIF/article-full-text-pdf/C28FCA865659.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133868283,"15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 1502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

We postulated that farmers' perception of soil erosion risk was high and this influenced their employment of Soil and Water Conservation (SWC) measures on their land. An adapted Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) was employed to model the soil erosion risk in a Geographical Information System (GIS) environment. Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) tools covering household interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) were implemented in two representative subcounties of the catchment to elicit information on farmers' perception of soil erosion risk. Household interviews covering 184 respondents were georeferenced using a Geographical Positioning System (GPS). Farmers perceived soil erosion risk on their land was then matched with RUSLE modelled risk using GPS positional data. The modelled soil erosion risk was substantial and a sizeable proportion of the catchment (63%) exhibited soil losses >10 t ha-1 yr-1, which is considered above the tolerable limit for mountain environments. A slight but significant agreement (p  0.05) between farmers' perceived soil erosion risk and implementation of SWC on their land. On this basis, our postulation that perceived high soil erosion risk influences the implementation of SWC does not suffice in the studied catchment. We surmise that successful risk mitigation should be directed more on increasing farmer's awareness of the long-term adverse consequences of soil erosion on their land.","Funding for this study was obtained from (1) SIDA-Embassy of Sweden, Kampala through the BREAD project-331.

Current control and eradication efforts are being frustrated by rapid changes in climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall. This study is aimed at assessing the impact of temperature and rainfall abundance on the intensity of malaria transmission. A human host-mosquito vector deterministic model which incorporates temperature and rainfall dependent parameters is formulated. The model is analysed for steady states and their stability. The basic reproduction number is obtained using the next-generation method. It was established that the mosquito population depends on a threshold value   θ   , defined as the number of mosquitoes produced by a female Anopheles mosquito throughout its lifetime, which is governed by temperature and rainfall. The conditions for the stability of the equilibrium points are investigated, and it is shown that there exists a unique endemic equilibrium which is locally and globally asymptotically stable whenever the basic reproduction number exceeds unity. Numerical simulations show that both temperature and rainfall affect the transmission dynamics of malaria; however, temperature has more influence.","Victor Yiga is grateful for the support from the Regional University Forum for Capacity Building in Agriculture (RUFORUM), Kyambogo University, and Mbarara University of Science and Technology to carry out this research.",Journal of Applied Mathematics,,,2020-12-19,2020,2020,,1-19,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yiga, Victor; Nampala, Hasifa; Tumwiine, Julius","Yiga, Victor (Department of Mathematics, Kyambogo University, P.O.Box 1, Kyambogo, Kampala, Uganda, kyu.ac.ug; Department of Mathematics, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, P.O.Box 1410, Mbarara, Uganda, must.ac.ug); Nampala, Hasifa (Department of Mathematics, Kyambogo University, P.O.Box 1, Kyambogo, Kampala, Uganda, kyu.ac.ug); Tumwiine, Julius (Department of Mathematics, Mbarara University of Science and Technology, P.O.Box 1410, Mbarara, Uganda, must.ac.ug)","Yiga, Victor (Kyambogo University; Mbarara University of Science and Technology)","Yiga, Victor (Kyambogo University; Mbarara University of Science and Technology); Nampala, Hasifa (Kyambogo University); Tumwiine, Julius (Mbarara University of Science and Technology)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2020/8885558,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133700000,0102 Applied Mathematics; 0103 Numerical and Computational Mathematics; 01 Mathematical Sciences,

In Uganda, knowledge on contraceptive use is high, amidst undesirably high contraceptive nonuse and scarce literature on predictors of contraceptive nonuse across regions. This study assessed factors associated with contraceptive nonuse among women of reproductive age across regions in Uganda.MethodThis study used data from a cross-sectional 2016 Uganda demographic and heath survey that had 18,506 women of reproductive age. The relationship between contraceptive nonuse and socio-economic and demographic factors across regions were assessed using a binary multivariable logistic regression model.ResultsIn Uganda, contraceptive nonuse is estimated at 40%. Northern region (55%) had the highest prevalence of contraceptive nonuse compared to Central region (35%) with the lowest. Across regions, wealth index, number of living children, educational level, and children born in the last 5 years prior to the demographic survey differently predicted contraceptive nonuse. Conversely, age, religion, age at first marriage, sexual autonomy, age at first birth, desire for children, listening to radio, and employment status were only predictors of contraceptive nonuse in particular regions amidst variations. Residence, perception of distance to health facility, watching television, and reading newspapers or magazines did not predict contraceptive nonuse.ConclusionsThe study findings propose the need to appreciate regional-variations in effect of contraceptive nonuse predictors and therefore, efforts should be directed towards addressing regional-variations so as to attain high contraceptive usage across regions, and thus reduce on unwanted pregnancies and births.",The author appreciates Measure DHS for offering him the permission to use 2016 UDHS data.,BMC Women's Health,,,2020-12-17,2020,20,1,275,All OA; Gold,Article,"Otim, Jude","Otim, Jude (Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, P.O.

This study aimed to document the quality of malaria case management in private health facilities innine districts in the Mid-Western region of Uganda, an area of moderate malaria transmission. Methods: This was a cross sectional study in which purposive sampling was used to select fifteen private-for-profit facilities from each district. An interviewer-administered questionnaire that contained both quantitative and open-ended questions was used. Information was collected on availability of treatment aides, knowledge on malaria, malaria case management, laboratory practices, malaria drugs stock and data management. We determined the proportion of health workers that adequately provided malaria case management according to national standards. Results: Of the 135 health facilities staff interviewed, 61.48% (52.91 - 69.40) had access to malaria treatment protocols while 48.89% (40.19 - 57.63) received malaria training. The majority of facilities, 98.52% (94.75 - 99.82) had malaria diagnostic services and the most commonly available anti-malarial drug was artemether-lumefantrine, 85.19% (78 - 91), followed by Quinine, 74.81% (67 - 82) and intravenous artesunate, 72.59% (64 – 80).

Specifically, 33.33% (25.46 - 41.96) responded correctly to management of a patient with a fever, 40.00% (31.67 - 48.79) responded correctly to the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, whereas 85.19% (78.05 - 90.71) responded correctly to severe malaria treatment. Only 28.83% submitted monthly reports, where malaria data was recorded, to the national database. Conclusion: This study revealed sub-optimal malaria case management practices at private health facilities with approximately 14% of health care workers demonstrating correct malaria case management cascade practices. To strengthen the quality of malaria case management, it is recommended that the NMCD distributes up to date guidelines and tools, coupled with training; continuous mentorship and integrated supportive supervision; provision of adequate stock of essential anti-malarials and RDTs; reinforcing communication and behavior change approach and increasing support for data management at private health facilities.",,Research Square,,,2020-12-09,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Wanzira, Humphrey; Tumwine, Daniel; Bukoma, Patrick; Musiime, Allan; Biculu, Juliet; Ediamu, Tom; Gudoi, Samuel; Tibenderana, James; Mulebeke, Ronald; Nantanda, Rebecca; Achan, Jane","Wanzira, Humphrey (Pilgrim Africa, Kampala, Uganda); Tumwine, Daniel (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala,Uganda); Bukoma, Patrick (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Musiime, Allan (Kyambogo University); Biculu, Juliet (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Ediamu, Tom (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Gudoi, Samuel (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Tibenderana, James (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Mulebeke, Ronald (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Nantanda, Rebecca (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Achan, Jane (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda)",,"Wanzira, Humphrey (); Tumwine, Daniel (); Bukoma, Patrick (Malaria Consortium); Musiime, Allan (Kyambogo University); Biculu, Juliet (); Ediamu, Tom (); Gudoi, Samuel (Malaria Consortium); Tibenderana, James (Malaria Consortium); Mulebeke, Ronald (); Nantanda, Rebecca (); Achan, Jane ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-25796/v2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133372073,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Projected increase in urbanisation to 50% in 2050 will only constrain the existing sanitation facilities, resulting in public health issues and competition for land use. This study investigates application of integrated waste-to-energy systems consisting of a combination of anaerobic digestion, incineration and composting to treat organic waste streams from urban areas. Despite the benefits of such systems related to resource recovery in form of biogas and organic fertiliser, little is known about their socio-cultural viability. A survey carried out at Uganda Christian University showed respondent's beliefs and cultural backgrounds influenced their attitude towards utilising resources recovered.

13,pub.1133243635,10.2166/nh.2020.111,,,Graphical-statistical method to explore variability of hydrological time series,"Abstract Due to increasing concern on developing measures for predictive adaptation to climate change impacts on hydrology, several studies have tended to be conducted on trends in climatic data. Conventionally, trend analysis comprises testing the null hypothesis H0 (no trend) by applying the Mann–Kendall or Spearman's rho test to the entire time series. This leads to lack of information about hidden short-durational increasing or decreasing trends (hereinafter called sub-trends) in the data. Furthermore, common trend tests are purely statistical in nature and their results can be meaningless sometimes, especially when not supported by graphical exploration of changes in the data. This paper presents a graphical-statistical methodology to identify and separately analyze sub-trends for supporting attribution of hydrological changes. The method is based on cumulative sum of differences between exceedance and non-exceedance counts of data points. Through the method, it is possible to appreciate that climate variability comprises large-scale random fluctuations in terms of rising and falling hydro-climatic sub-trends which can be associated with certain attributes. Illustration on how to apply the introduced methodology was made using data over the White Nile region in Africa.

2,pub.1133309385,10.3390/resources9120142,,,The Potential for Citizen Science to Improve the Reach of Sanitary Inspections,"To achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6, universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking-water quality and sanitation for all, and 10, to reduce inequality within and among countries, additional and urgent work is required. Efforts to achieve these Goals in the context of small drinking-water supplies, which are the furthest behind in regards to progress, are of particular need. Reasons for this disparity in progress include the remoteness of access to small drinking-water supplies and the lack of technical and financial capacity for monitoring supplies. The World Health Organization promote the use of Sanitary inspection (SI) as an on-site assessment of risk. Despite the potential to increase the body of knowledge and information on supplies in a region, there has been limited research into the role of citizen science and SIs. To meet SDG targets, we need to improve the reach of SIs. This study uses a mixed methods approach of quantitative on-site SI data collection and remote SI data collection via photographic images, together with qualitative data collection, collected by non-expert students, who are citizens of Malawi, as well as a panel of experts in the field of SI. Results indicate that, although further research into the topic is required prior to widescale implementation, the potential exists for citizens to conduct SI, with remote expert verification of the results using photographic images of supplies. Further documentation or guidance is required to support citizens in this process. The results highlight a critical gap in the availability of appropriate documentation for unprotected spring sources which is urgently required. The use of citizen science for SI data collection is in its infancy. However, this study indicates that there is potential to explore the use of citizen science in this area, which will contribute to achieving SDGs 6 and 10.","The authors would like to thank the students of The University of Malawi—The Polytechnic for their contributions and enthusiasm throughout this study. The authors would also like to thank the Ntcheu District Water Officers who facilitated and guided the researchers to the study locations.

2,pub.1132133007,10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102360,,,Analysis of spatial co-occurrence between cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality and its spatial variation among the Swedish elderly (2010–2015),"CVD and cancer are the two leading causes of death worldwide. Improvement in cancer early detection and treatment has resulted in an increased number of cancer survivors. However, many of the survivors tend to develop CVD often leading to their demise. Conversely, people with pre-existing CVD conditions, especially the elderly, have increased chances of developing cancer and dying from the same. The World Health Organization, consequently, recommends joint management of both diseases. However, in Sweden, as with many other countries, few studies have explored the nature of the associations between the two disease mortalities and their spatial variation at a population level. This study uses correlation, global Moran's index and global bivariate Moran's index to investigate national trends of cancer and CVD crude mortality rates in the Swedish elderly. Spatial scan statistics, spatial overlay and local entropy maps were used to analyse for spatial co-occurrence, local joint spatial clustering and associations in the 2010–2015 cancer and CVD crude mortality rates for the Swedish elderly (65+ years). Mortality data were obtained from the Swedish Healthcare Registry. Our results showed that throughout the years of study, the correlation between cancer and CVD crude mortality rates was averagely positive. Spatial correlation analysis (univariate and bivariate) showed that the contribution of the neighbourhood mortality rates to the observed mortality rates was weak, though significant. From cluster analysis, the cancer and CVD crude mortality rates showed differences in clustering spatial scales with CVD clustering at a smaller scale. Finally, local entropy maps showed that cancer and CVD crude mortality rates were not always related across Sweden, but whenever they were, the relationship was mainly positive and linear. This study contributes to cancer and CVD public health efforts in Sweden by identifying areas where the two causes of death spatially co-occur, and where the two exhibit no spatial overlap. This provides a valuable starting ground for more focused studies to identify local drivers and/or informs coordinated targeted intervention in both causes of death.","We would wish to appreciate the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the Swedish Research Council and the Swedish Heart-Lung foundation for providing the funding for this research.",Applied Geography,,,2020-12,2020,125,,102360,All OA; Gold,Article,"Aturinde, Augustus; Mansourian, Ali; Farnaghi; Pilesjö, Petter; Sundquist, Kristina; Maiga, Gilbert","Aturinde, Augustus (GIS Centre, Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden; College of Computing and Information Science, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda; Department of Lands and Architectural Studies, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Mansourian, Ali (GIS Centre, Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden); Farnaghi (GIS Centre, Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden); Pilesjö, Petter (GIS Centre, Department of Physical Geography and Ecosystem Science, Lund University, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden); Sundquist, Kristina (Center for Primary Health Care Research, Department of Clinical Sciences, Malmö, Lund University, Sweden); Maiga, Gilbert (College of Computing and Information Science, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda)","Aturinde, Augustus (Lund University; Makerere University; Kyambogo University)","Aturinde, Augustus (Lund University; Makerere University; Kyambogo University); Mansourian, Ali (Lund University); Farnaghi (Lund University); Pilesjö, Petter (Lund University); Sundquist, Kristina (Lund University); Maiga, Gilbert (Makerere University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2020.102360,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132133007,16 Studies in Human Society; 1604 Human Geography; 0406 Physical Geography and Environmental Geoscience; 04 Earth Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, the role of workplace attachment intervening the link between these two variables has not been researched. Looking at the growing research interest in OCB in academic context, this study aimed to test a mediation model of these three variables in a university context. A structured questionnaire comprising scales on place attachment and OCB was used to collect data from staff of the studied university. Correlation analysis and structural equation modeling of a total of 323 responses (after outlier elimination) was conducted using SPSS 24.0 and AMOS 23.0. It was found out that with the increase in tenure, employees’ attachment to place and their OCB enhanced. It was also found that workplace attachment was a significant mediator of tenure and OCB, implying that tenure enhanced workplace attachment and attachment further enhanced OCB. Based on the previous place attachment literature, it was suggested that there should be meaningful interactions between employees and the physical and group setting, which would foster employees’ emotional bonding with the organization.

Among the contributing factors for this increase is the marketing of unhealthy food products, which affects children’s dietary preferences, food choices, purchasing requests, and consumption patterns. Given that little is known about food marketing in Africa, including in Uganda, monitoring children’s exposure to food marketing is essential to generate evidence on the problem and develop meaningful policy responses. The aim of this study was to describe the food and beverage marketing environment surrounding schools in urban and peri-urban areas of Kampala city. Methods: Outdoor advertising around 25 randomly sampled primary- and secondary schools within a radius of 250 meters of each school was mapped. Information on size, setting, type, and position of the advertisements and the healthiness of the food and beverage promoted was collected using the INFORMAS Outdoor Advertising Protocol. The occurrence of advertising was described using frequencies, median, and density per 100m2. Results: A total of 1,034 branded advertisements was identified around the schools. Of these, 86% featured unhealthy products, 8% healthy, and 6 % miscellaneous. The most advertised products were sugar-sweetened beverages and alcoholic beverages (51% and 23%, respectively). Schools in the urban area were surrounded by more unhealthy ads than those in the peri-urban areas (median of 45 vs 24 ads). Conclusion: The considerable extent of unhealthy food and beverage advertisements around primary and secondary schools highlights the need for food marketing regulation in Uganda, in line with the World Health Organization’ recommendations, to ensure that young people are protected from unhealthy food marketing messages.",,Research Square,,,2020-11-24,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Dia, Oumy Erica; Løvhaug, Anne; Rukundo, Peter; Torheim, Liv","Dia, Oumy Erica (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University); Løvhaug, Anne (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University); Rukundo, Peter (Kyambogo University); Torheim, Liv (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University)",,"Dia, Oumy Erica (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University); Løvhaug, Anne (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University); Rukundo, Peter (Kyambogo University); Torheim, Liv (OsloMet – Oslo Metropolitan University)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-107009/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132910375,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,11 Sustainable Cities and Communities
1,pub.1133435889,10.47577/tssj.v14i1.2089,,,Religious Conflict among Pentecostal Churches in Uganda:,"Extensive research has been done on Pentecostal churches over the past years. Several studies have focused on their history and robust growth, some on their economic and developmental ethos, while others have focused on their theological stances, and growing political influence in society. Amidst these kinds of studies, is the need to address the overt challenge posed by religious conflict among Pentecostal churches. Whereas there is growing scholarly interest in religious conflict among Christian churches, this has been narrowed to intra-church conflict. However, studies on inter-church conflict, between separate Pentecostal churches, that are independent of each other, are rare. Yet inter-church feuds and conflicts among Pentecostal churches in Uganda occupy a significant part of public space and discourses. Through analysis of both print and electronic media reports and engagement with twenty key informant interviewees, this article sought to establish and analyse the nature, manifestations and root causes of inter-church conflict between Pentecostal churches in Uganda. The study established that Pentecostal pastors are not only the major protagonists of inter-church conflicts but also act as collective agents for the churches in conflict. The study further established that religious conflicts among Pentecostal churches are caused by different ideological inclinations, theological differences notwithstanding, but mainly by the desire to dominate the religious market and by power struggle dynamics within the religious leadership. This tension has a particular impact on society given pastors’ visibility, access to media and their public action in the Ugandan context.",,Technium Social Sciences Journal,,,2020-11-23,2020,14,,616-644,All OA; Gold,Article,"Isiko, Alexander Paul","Isiko, Alexander Paul (Kyambogo University)",,"Isiko, Alexander Paul (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,https://techniumscience.com/index.php/socialsciences/article/download/2089/860,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133435889,22 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 2204 Religion and Religious Studies,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Accurate rapid diagnosis is crucial for early treatment initiation and prevention of severe disease. Despite over 10 years approval of molecular diagnostics for routine use, an estimated 3 million TB cases go undetected per year. We investigated the barriers and opportunities to maximise uptake and utilization of molecular diagnostics in routine healthcare settings. Methods: We deployed surveys, healthcare facility audits, focus group discussions, in-depth interviews, and policymaker dialogues to unravel factors affecting the uptake and utilization of TB molecular diagnostics in three East African countries. The benchmark was the World Health Organization approved Xpert MTB/RIF and Line Probe Assay (LPA) implemetation at district and regional hospital level respectively.  Results: 190 district and county health officers participated in the survey. The survey findings were corroborated by 145 healthcare facility (HCF) audits and 11 policymaker engagement workshops. At 66% coverage, Xpert MTB/RIF fell behind microscopy and clinical diagnosis by 33% and 1% respectively across 190 districts/counties. Stratified by HCF type, Xpert MTB/RIF implementation was 56%, 96% and 95% at district-, regional- and national referral- hospital level. LPA coverage was 4%, 3% below culture across the three countries. Out of 111 HCFs with Xpert MTB/RIF, 37 (33%) utilized it to full capacity, performing ≥8 tests per day of which 51% of these were level five (zonal consultant and national referral) HCFs. Likewise, 75% of LPA test performance was at level five HCFs. Underutilization of Xpert MTB/RIF and LPA was mainly attributed to inadequate- human resource, 22% and utilities, 26% respectively. Absence of the diagnostic services was attributed to under financing. Lack of awareness was second to underfinancing as reason underlying absence of LPA service.

Cotton materials are among the most attractive substrates, given that they are inexpensive, environmentally benign, light, accessible, and processable. Incorporation of conductive materials onto cotton textiles modifies their surface chemistry by allowing free movement of electrons and other atomic species like radicals in metallic and non-metallic nanoparticles, delocalization of π-electrons with high mobility owed to the continuous overlap of π-orbitals along the backbone of conductive polymers, and free transfer of charges. On the addition to a large surface area and enhanced mechanical strength of the substrate, the conductive cotton textiles can provide chemical applications such as electrical and thermal conductivity, energy storage, sensitivity, EMI shielding, catalysis, and redox detoxification of certain pollutant chemicals in the environment.

Although slower than in urban or high-income settings, the uptake of WSPs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is accelerating. Understanding the factors which will make a WSP successful will further improve efficient uptake and assist with its long-term sustainability. Based on an extensive literature search using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISM-A) methodology, 48 publications, including case studies and guidance documentation, formed the basis of this review. These were analysed using inductive and deductive coding methods to (i) identify the success factors applicable to WSP implementation in small drinking water supplies in LMICs and (ii) to investigate which factors are more or less critical depending on the geography and level of development of the implementing country. Key challenges identified during the review process were also noted. A comparison of these success factors was made with those identified from high-income and urban settings. The three most important success factors identified are the development of technical capacity, community engagement, and monitoring and verification. Factors specific to small drinking water supplies in LMICs include support from non-government organisations, integration into existing water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programs, simplicity, and community engagement. Certain factors, such as adaptability, the use of guidance documentation, international collaboration, the role of pilot studies, knowledge sharing, and stakeholder involvement are applicable to all WSP settings. Due to the specific challenges faced by small drinking water systems and the limited number of original research publications on this topic, this study highlights the need for further data collection and research focused on success factors in these settings. It is anticipated that the consideration of the success factors identified in this study will assist implementers in improving the uptake and long-term sustainability of WSPs in small drinking water supplies in low- and middle-income settings.",,Resources,,,2020-10-28,2020,9,11,126,All OA; Gold,Article,"Herschan, Jo; Rickert, Bettina; Mkandawire, Theresa; Okurut, Kenan; King, Richard; Hughes, Susan J.; Lapworth, Dan J.; Pond, Katherine","Herschan, Jo (Centre for Environmental Health and Engineering (CEHE), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK;, r.a.king@surrey.ac.uk, (R.K.);, sue.hughes@surrey.ac.uk, (S.J.H.);, k.pond@surrey.ac.uk, (K.P.)); Rickert, Bettina (German Environment Agency (UBA), Schichauweg 58, 12307 Berlin, Germany;, Bettina.Rickert@uba.de); Mkandawire, Theresa (Department of Civil Engineering, University of Malawi—The Polytechnic, Private Bag 303, Blantyre, Malawi;, tmkandawire@poly.ac.mw); Okurut, Kenan (Department of Civil and Building Engineering, University of Kyambogo, Kyambogo Road, Kiwatule-Banda, Kampala, Uganda;, ken_okurut@yahoo.com); King, Richard (Centre for Environmental Health and Engineering (CEHE), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK;, r.a.king@surrey.ac.uk, (R.K.);, sue.hughes@surrey.ac.uk, (S.J.H.);, k.pond@surrey.ac.uk, (K.P.)); Hughes, Susan J.

This study explored the stakeholders’ perceptions of the community nutrition and dietetics needs, the nature of work done by graduates of the Bachelor’s degree in Human Nutrition/Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HN/HND), and the competencies required of Nutrition and Dietetics professionals in Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods design was used. Respondents included 132 graduates of the Bachelor’s degrees in HN/HND obtained from the Makerere and Kyambogo Universities in 2005-2016; 14 academic staff that train HN/HND in the two universities; and 11 HN/HND work/internship supervisors. Data from the graduates was collected through an email-based survey; data from other participants was through face to face interviews using researcher administered questionnaires.  Results: Most HN/HND respondents (84.8%) obtained their Bachelor's degrees from Kyambogo University; 61.4% graduated in 2013-2016. Most (64.3%) academic staff respondents were females and the majority (57.1%) had doctorate training. All stakeholders viewed communities as facing a variety of nutrition and dietetics challenges cutting across different Sustainable Development Goals. The nutrition and dietetics interventions requested for, provided, and considered a priority for communities were both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive. Work done by HN/HND graduates encompassed seven main competency domains; the dominant being organizational leadership and management; management of nutrition-related disease conditions; nutrition and health promotion; research; and advocacy, communication, and awareness creation. Conclusions: This study shows that nutrition and dietetics challenges in Uganda are multifaceted. HN/HND graduates are employed in different sectors; provide nutrition-specific and sensitive services in a multisectoral environment; are expected to possess a variety of knowledge and skills. However, graduates have knowledge and skills gaps in some areas they are expected to exhibit competency. We recommend using these findings as a basis for obtaining stakeholder consensus on the key competencies that should be exhibited by all HN/HND graduates in Uganda; developing a HN/HND competency-based education model and a national HN/HND training and practice standard, and undertaking further research to understand the quality and relevancy of HN/HND curricula to Uganda’s job market requirements.",,Research Square,,,2020-10-24,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Kikomeko, Peterson Kato; Ochola, Sophie; Kaaya, Archileo N.; Ogada, Irene; Birungi, Tracy Lukiya; Nakitto, Peace","Kikomeko, Peterson Kato (Kyambogo University); Ochola, Sophie (Kenyatta University); Kaaya, Archileo N.

The disaster domain largely relies on the top–down approach of ontology development. This limits reuse due to associated commitments and complex alignments within ontologies. Therefore, there is a need to utilize a bottom-up approach that reuses patterns for representing disaster knowledge. To bridge the availability gap of patterns for representing disaster knowledge, this study identifies existing and emerging patterns for reuse while organizing disaster data from multiple sector stakeholders. Based on the eXtreme Design (XD) methodology and key informant interviews, competency questions (CQs) were elicited from domain stakeholders. The CQs are matched with existing patterns from other contexts. Emerging patterns (e.g the Event Classification and Quality Dependence Description for Objects) are also developed for CQs not captured and subsequently tested using SPARQL queries characterising the CQs. It is in this context that this paper presents a characterisation of disaster risk knowledge using CQs and corresponding patterns (reusable and emerging) covering the knowledge. Accordingly, we illustrate a pattern-driven use case to organise drought hazard data for early warning purposes. This provides a powerful use case for adopting a pattern-based approach to knowledge representation in the disaster domain.",,SN Computer Science,,,2020-10-22,2020,1,6,353,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mazimwe, Allan; Hammouda, Imed; Gidudu, Anthony; Barasa, Bernard","Mazimwe, Allan (Department of Geomatics and Land Management, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda); Hammouda, Imed (Mediterranean Institute of Technology, South Mediterranean University, Tunis, Tunisia); Gidudu, Anthony (Department of Geomatics and Land Management, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda); Barasa, Bernard (Department of Geography and Social Studies, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Mazimwe, Allan (Makerere University)","Mazimwe, Allan (Makerere University); Hammouda, Imed (); Gidudu, Anthony (Makerere University); Barasa, Bernard (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42979-020-00342-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131961209,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0801 Artificial Intelligence and Image Processing; 0806 Information Systems,

Results: SIMPAQ walking and SIMPAQ exercise explained 46% of the variability in physical QoL, 45% of the variability in psychological QoL, and 40% of the variability in environmental QoL. The SIMPAQ walking score predicted 37% of the variability in social QoL. Conclusion: The current findings suggest that higher levels of walking and exercising are associated with a better QoL. Our study therefore provides a platform for future research to investigate the role of physical activity on QoL levels in people with AUD, also in low resourced settings in low-income countries such as Uganda.

DESIGN: Data were collected through focus group discussions (FGD). The FGD guide was based on a modified theoretical framework; theory of planned behaviour was incorporated with constructs of health belief model, precaution adoption process model, social cognitive and social support theory. Discussions were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically.
SETTING: Kampala, Uganda.
PARTICIPANTS: Women were categorised into young adults; 18-34 years and adults; 35-45 years.
RESULTS: Separate FGD with independent participants were conducted for dietary and physical activity behaviours until data saturation was achieved. Six FGD were conducted per behaviour. Determinants of dietary behaviours at intra-individual level included gaps in food skills, knowledge and self-efficacy, food safety concerns, convenience, finances and physiological satisfaction. The social-cultural norms were relationship between vegetable consumption and low social status, consideration of fruits as a snack for children and not food and habitual orientation towards carbohydrate foods. At environment level, social networks and increased availability of energy-dense, nutrient poor, street and processed foods influence dietary behaviour. For physical activity, intra-individual determinants were knowledge gaps and self-efficacy, while socio-cultural norms included gender stereotypes. Home (limited space and sedentary entertainment like social media and TV) and physical environment (cheap motorised transportation) influence physical activity.
CONCLUSION: The existing cultural beliefs promote dietary and physical activity behaviours which are divergent from healthy recommendations. Therefore, a comprehensive intervention is needed to address socio-cultural misconceptions, financial and time limitations in urban Uganda.",,Public Health Nutrition,,,2020-10-01,2020,,,1-13,Closed,Article,"Yiga, Peter; Ogwok, Patrick; Achieng, Julian; Auma, Mary Devota; Seghers, Jan; Matthys, Christophe","Yiga, Peter (Department of Food Technology, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.; Nutrition & Obesity Unit, Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Aging, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.); Ogwok, Patrick (Department of Food Technology, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.); Achieng, Julian (Department of Food Technology, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.); Auma, Mary Devota (Department of Food Technology, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.); Seghers, Jan (Department of Movement Sciences, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.); Matthys, Christophe (Nutrition & Obesity Unit, Clinical and Experimental Endocrinology, Department of Chronic Diseases, Metabolism and Aging, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; Clinical Nutrition Unit, Department of Endocrinology, University Hospitals Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.)",,"Yiga, Peter (Kyambogo University; KU Leuven); Ogwok, Patrick (Kyambogo University); Achieng, Julian (Kyambogo University); Auma, Mary Devota (Kyambogo University); Seghers, Jan (KU Leuven); Matthys, Christophe (KU Leuven; Universitair Ziekenhuis Leuven)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131339906,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Quantitative Evidence from the Mukono District, Uganda","Sanitary inspections (SIs) are checklists of questions used for achieving/maintaining the safety of drinking-water supplies by identifying observable actual and potential sources and pathways of contamination. Despite the widespread use of SIs, the effects of training on SI response are understudied. Thirty-six spring supplies were inspected on two occasions, pre- and post-training, by an instructor from the research team and four local inspectors in the Mukono District of Uganda. SI score agreement between the instructor and each inspector was calculated using Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient. Average SI score agreement between the instructor and all inspectors increased post-training for the Yes/No answer type (0.262 to 0.490). For the risk level answer type (e.g., No, Low, Medium, High), average SI score agreement between the instructor and all inspectors increased post-training (0.301 to 0.380). Variability of SI scores between the four inspectors was calculated using coefficient of variation analysis. Average SI score variability between inspectors reduced post-training for both answer types, Yes/No (21.25 to 16.16) and risk level (24.12 to 19.62). Consistency of answer agreement between the four inspectors for each individual SI question was calculated using index of dispersion analysis. Average answer dispersion between inspectors reduced post-training for both answer types, Yes/No (0.41 to 0.27) and risk level (0.55 to 0.41). The findings indicate that training has a positive effect on improving answer agreement between inspectors. However, advanced training or tailoring of SI questions to the local context may be required where inconsistency of responses between inspectors persists, especially for the risk level answer type that requires increased use of inspector risk perception. Organisations should be aware of the potential inconsistency of results between inspectors so that this may be rectified with appropriate training and, where necessary, better SI design and customisation.",,Resources,,,2020-10-01,2020,9,10,120,All OA; Gold,Article,"King, Richard; Okurut, Kenan; Herschan, Jo; Lapworth, Dan J.; Malcolm, Rosalind; McKeown, Rory Moses; Pond, Katherine","King, Richard (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK;, j.herschan@surrey.ac.uk, (J.H.);, k.pond@surrey.ac.uk, (K.P.)); Okurut, Kenan (Department of Civil and Building Engineering, University of Kyambogo, Kiwatule—Banda, Kampala, Uganda;, ken_okurut@yahoo.com); Herschan, Jo (Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of Surrey, Guildford, Surrey GU2 5XH, UK;, j.herschan@surrey.ac.uk, (J.H.);, k.pond@surrey.ac.uk, (K.P.)); Lapworth, Dan J.

Based in Napak District, this study was aimed at gaining an understanding of the role of proper health management in reducing goat mortality in Kraals. Through convenience sampling, 312 pastoralists out of 388 who own animals in community kraals were reached. The study was carried out using mixed methods approach through structured interviews and focus group discussions to collect both primary and secondary data. The health management index (HMI) as a measure of proper goat health management was constructed using seven routine farm practices (Vaccination, Deworming, Use of Antibiotic, Spraying, Isolation of sick animals, Sanitation and Hygiene and Navel Cord Disinfection). Multivariable regression was conducted using STATA (12) software. The first regression was conducted to find out which socio-economic factors have influence on HMI. It was established that accessibility to training and membership to social groups improve HMP while involvement in other occupation has a negative influence. A second regression was conducted to ascertain if HMI scores affect goat mortality levels. The results revealed a negative and significant influence, implying that an improvement in HMP leads to a reduction in mortality. Enhancing mechanisms which favor practical training and social group formation in form of technology intervention platforms can enhance HMP which will ultimately reduce goat mortality.

This study evaluated the effect of cooking locally available pumpkin, Sweet cream (Cucurbita moschata) on PVACs retention in Uganda. Furthermore, the effect of cooking locally available common bean, Obwelu (Phaseolus vulgaris) on iron and zinc retention was evaluated. Expert caregivers from the local community cooked pumpkin by either boiling or steaming, while common bean was cooked by either boiling with prior soaking or boiling without prior soaking. PVACs in raw and cooked pumpkin were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), while iron and zinc in raw and cooked common bean were analyzed by flame atomic absorption spectroscopy (FAAS). Conversion of PVACs into vitamin A retinol activity equivalents (RAE) was calculated using the Institute of Medicine (2001) recommendations for the bioconversion of PVACs into vitamin A. Micronutrient retention was measured using true retention. β-carotene, α-carotene, and vitamin A content in raw pumpkin was 1,704 µg/100 g, 46 µg/100 g and 1,437 µgRAE/100 g, respectively. Either boiling or steaming pumpkin resulted in over 100% retention of PVACs and vitamin A. Iron and zinc retention for boiled common bean with prior soaking was 92.2% and 91.3%, respectively. Boiling common bean without prior soaking resulted in 88.4% and 75.6% retention of iron and zinc, respectively. In conclusion, to retain a high proportion of PVACs caregivers should be advised to cook Sweet cream by either boiling or steaming, while to retain a high proportion of iron and zinc, Obwelu should be prepared by boiling with prior soaking.","The authors would like to thank the Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division (HEARD), University of KwaZulu‐Natal, for the financial assistance during the study.",Food Science & Nutrition,,,2020-09-20,2020,8,11,5916-5925,All OA; Gold,Article,"Buzigi, Edward; Pillay, Kirthee; Siwela, Muthulisi","Buzigi, Edward (Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of KwaZulu‐Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa; Health Economics and HIV/AIDS Research Division (HEARD), University of KwaZulu‐Natal, Durban, South Africa; Department of Human Nutrition & Home Economics, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Pillay, Kirthee (Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of KwaZulu‐Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa); Siwela, Muthulisi (Department of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, School of Agricultural, Earth and Environmental Sciences, University of KwaZulu‐Natal, Pietermaritzburg, South Africa)",,"Buzigi, Edward (University of KwaZulu-Natal; University of KwaZulu-Natal; Kyambogo University); Pillay, Kirthee (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Siwela, Muthulisi (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",1,1,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/fsn3.1873,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130995274,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

This study explored the stakeholders’ perceptions of the community nutrition and dietetics needs, the nature of work done by graduates of the Bachelor’s degree in Human Nutrition/Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HN/HND), and the competencies required of Nutrition and Dietetics professionals in Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods design was used. Respondents included 132 graduates of the Bachelor’s degrees in HN/HND obtained from the Makerere and Kyambogo Universities during the period 2005-2016; 14 academic staff that train HN/HND in the two universities; and 10 HN/HND work/internship supervisors. Data from the graduates was collected through an email-based survey while that from other participants was through face to face interviews using a structured key informant interview guide.  Results: Most HN/HND respondents (84.8%) obtained their Bachelor's degrees from Kyambogo University and 61.4% graduated in the years 2013-2016. Most (64.3%) academic staff that responded were females and the majority (57.1%) had doctorate training. All stakeholders viewed communities as facing a variety of nutrition and dietetics challenges some of which fall across different Sustainable Development Goals. The nutrition and dietetics interventions requested, provided, and considered a priority to provide to communities were both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive. Work done by HN/HND graduates encompassed seven main domains; the dominant being organizational leadership and management; management of nutrition-related disease conditions; nutrition and health promotion; research and documentation; and advocacy, communication, and awareness. Conclusions: This study shows that nutrition and dietetics challenges in Uganda are multifaceted. HN/HND graduates are employed in different sectors; provide nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions in a multisectoral environment; are expected to possess a variety of knowledge and skills. However, graduates have knowledge and skills gaps even in some of the key areas they are expected to exhibit competency.

The aim of this study was to develop a fine-scaled copy number variation map for African goats. We used sequence data from multiple breeds and from multiple African countries. Results A total of 253,553 CNV (244,876 deletions and 8,677 duplications) were identified, corresponding to an overall average of 1,393 CNV per animal. The mean CNV length was 3.3 kb, with a median of 1.3 kb. There was substantial differentiation between the populations for some CNV, suggestive of the effect of population-specific selective pressures. A total of 6,231 global CNV regions (CNVR) were found across all animals, representing 59.2 Mb (2.4%) of the goat genome. About 1.6% of the CNVR were present in all 34 breeds and 28.7% were present in all 5 geographical areas across Africa, where animals had been sampled. The CNVR had genes that were highly enriched in important biological functions, molecular functions, and cellular components including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, glutamatergic synapse and circadian entrainment.

We examine the effect of entrepreneurship training in conjunction with capital constraints, which entrepreneurs frequently experience in the context of developing countries and emerging economies. We develop a theoretical model that explains how entrepreneurship training attenuates the negative effect of capital constraints on business creation by developing financial mental models. To test our model, we conducted two longitudinal, randomized field experiments in developing countries. Our studies show a moderation effect of entrepreneurship training on the relationship between capital constraints and business creation. Results reveal that financial mental models mediated this moderation. The study demonstrates the role that entrepreneurship training plays in dealing with capital constraints in entrepreneurship in developing countries and emerging economies. A major barrier for entrepreneurship is capital constraints. In the context of developing countries and emerging economies, where people experience severe capital constraints, the common thinking suggests improving access to capital as the major solution for overcoming capital constraints in business creation. Our study provides empirical evidence for a different point of view: It emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurship training as an effective means to cope with capital constraints when starting businesses. Our findings show that entrepreneurship training reduces the negative effect of capital constraints on business creation through financial mental models. This implies that entrepreneurship training improves participants' financial mental models and hence supports them in starting businesses despite capital constraints. Consequently, we recommend promoting entrepreneurship training to overcome capital constraints in business creation.","This research was supported by Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD, German Academic Exchange Service; ID 50020279 and ID 54391079), the German Commission for UNESCO (Deutsche UNESCO Kommission), BASF Foundation (BASF Stiftung) (STEP‐2012‐2013), and National University of Singapore (R‐317‐000‐084‐133/R‐317‐000‐095‐112).

This study compared child acceptability of BPB and PB (control). Methods The crossover acceptability study randomly assigned Ugandan children 6 to 24 months old to either receive 100 g of BPB (n=35) or 100 g of PB (n=35) on day one. After a washout period of one day, children crossed over to receive either BPB (n=35) or PB (n=35). The amount of CF consumed, duration of consumption, and micronutrient intake were assessed. The CF was acceptable if children consumed ≥ 50 g (50%) of served food (100 g). A paired t-test was used to determine the mean differences within participants between BPB and PB. The level of statistical significant difference was set at a probability value of 5% (p= 0.05). Results The mean consumption of BPB and PB was 53.9 g and 54.4 g, respectively. The mean duration for consumption of BPB and PB was 20.6 and 20.3 minutes, respectively. There was no significant difference in the amounts consumed, and duration of consumption in BPB and PB (p >0.05). The mean intake of vitamin A was significantly higher (p <0.00001) in PB (152.5 µgRAE) compared to BPB (100.9 µgRAE). The mean iron intake was significantly higher in BPB (1.1mg) (p <0.00001) compared to PB (0.3mg). Furthermore, zinc intake was significantly higher (p <0.00001) in BPB (0.58mg) compared to PB (0.13 mg). Conclusion A homemade complementary food, BPB, made from locally available common bean and pumpkin is rich in PVACs, iron and zinc and is acceptable to children in the age range of complementary feeding in Uganda.",,Research Square,,,2020-09-02,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Buzigi, Edward; Pillay, Kirthee; Siwela, Muthulisi","Buzigi, Edward (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Pillay, Kirthee (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Siwela, Muthulisi (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",,"Buzigi, Edward (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Pillay, Kirthee (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Siwela, Muthulisi (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-15355/v2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130568771,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1114 Paediatrics and Reproductive Medicine,

Algae was cultured in 25L rectangular glass tanks with 24 hour illumination and aeration. Ammonia, pH and counts of algae cells/ml were recorded daily for 24 days. Chlorella spp. production rate, effect of intrinsic ammonia and pH on culture performance, duration of culture cycle and the di fferences in resultant fatty acid composition of the algae were tested. Results indicated a significant effect of culture media on the growth performance of Chlorella spp. (F = 3.42, P< 0.05), although the interaction between time (day) and nutrient media was also significant (F = 17.27, P< 0.05). Bold’s Basal Media had significantly lower mean abundance of Chlorella spp. per millilitre than all the other media (F = 20.65, 13.57±7.1×104, P< 0.05). However, Soybean media supported significantly higher densities of Chlorella spp. than other media (F = 20.65, 20.65, 21.53±7.4×104, P< 0.05). The abundance of Chlorella in DAP/UREA and Cow dung media did not differ significantly (F = 20.65, 17.01×104±4.3 and 18.43±6.0×104, P = 0.46 respectively). There was a notable positive effect of pH on growth of Chlorella whereas ammonia did not have much impact even at relatively high concentrations (236.095 mg l-1 in DAP/UREA). Of the fatty acids in Chlorella, polyunsaturated fatty acids (>40% of Total Fatty Acids) were predominant in all media.

Merr) is an important fruit crop in Uganda ranking third as a major fruit crop after banana and citrus globally. However, pineapple production in Uganda is threatened by the recent outbreaks of pineapple heart rot disease (PHRD). Pineapple heart rot disease is the most widespread and devastating disease of pineapple in Uganda and can cause tremendous yield loss. Information on the sources of resistance is still scanty in Uganda. Additionally, no study has been done in Uganda which point out whether variety influences disease severity. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the reaction of pineapple cultivars to pineapple heart rot disease in central Uganda. Five cultivars of healthy pineapple suckers were planted in the field in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) to screen for resistance to PHRD. No significant (p > 0.05) relationship in PHRD incidence was recorded in week two and week 4 of the experiment.

This region has been marginalized politically and economically by its physical distance from central government in southern Uganda. This is related partly to social and economic disparity during the colonial period, and partly to the delay of developmental investment in the region due to the destabilization caused by violent incidents and administrative changes, which continued for several decades after Ugandan independence. This article focuses on two issues. Firstly, it looks into what kind of violence people in West Nile faced after Idi Amin’s regime fell in 1979 until the current government seized power in 1986. Secondly, it examines peoples’ experiences during their exile and after repatriation. According to archival data obtained from Arua District in West Nile and a literature review, the violence of this period can be categorized into the following three types: ‘revenge’ by the UNLF government against former soldiers of Amin’s army; disturbance of political rivals and their supporters during the general election of late 1980; and the massacre and widespread damage in northern, eastern and central West Nile. This resulted in a tremendous number of killings, including those of ordinary people. However, it is complex and difficult to identify killers and victims. Empirical data obtained by fieldwork among the Lugbara people in a rural village bordering with DRC shows that, even in this situation, some factors enabled people to evacuate and repatriate easily and strategically compared to other parts of West Nile. This article explores how kinship ties extending beyond the national border worked to help residents make their lives secure, and it concludes that it is important to pay attention to the complexity of triggers which prompted people to take refuge, and to the diversity of ways people escaped to the neighboring states.",,アジア・アフリカ地域研究,,,2020-09,2020,20,1,92-127,Closed,Article,"暢子, 山崎","暢子, 山崎 (京都大学大学院アジア・アフリカ地域研究研究科)",,"暢子, 山崎 (Kyoto University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132459983,1606 Political Science; 16 Studies in Human Society,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth"

However, its productivity is constrained by ticks and tick-borne diseases (TTBDs), more importantly, East Cost Fever (ECF) whose epidemiology is not well known and understood in the cattle corridor. Methodology: A cross-sectional study was carried out in pastoral and mixed crop-livestock farming systems in Nakaseke and Nakasongola districts to understand the; local composition of ticks, the prevalence of Theileria parva and management of ECF and ticks. A structured closed-ended questionnaire was administered in (189) pastoral and (197) mixed-crop livestock households which were randomly selected, and a total of 384 calves were sampled. The tick challenge was assessed in situ on one side of the animal body considering different predilection sites. The prevalence of ECF was assessed by collecting whole blood in Ethylene Diamine Tetra acetic Acid (EDTA) tubes following veni-puncture. Thin and thick blood smears were made and serum samples were collected for determination of seroprevalence of ECF, using Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Results/Discussion: From a sample of 384 cattle surveyed, 316 (82.3%) were found to be infested with ticks of different species at their preferential predilection sites. Rhipicephalus. appendiculatus was the most abundant tick species (88.2%), followed by Ambryomma. variegatum (7.5%) and lastly Rhipicephalus. evertsi evertsi (4.3%). 80.7% of respondents believe that there was a tick infestation problem severe and ticks were managed on regular basis mainly by using acaricides (65.3%). In the pastoral farming system, no ticks were found on calves below 6 months old. The seroprevalence of T. parva was below 20% percentage positivity (pp)in calves below 4 months old, thereafter rising to 65% at 5 months, and then dropping to 20% from the age of 6 to 9 months. In mixed crop-livestock farming system, all age groups of cattle were exposed to tick challenge. The prevalence of T. parva increased from 1-month old calf reaching a peak in 2-3 months old calves but drastically dropped in calves 4 months old. Thereafter, it gradually built up to 70% in animals 7 months old. There was a moderate correlation between the mean number of R. appendiculatus ticks and seroprevalence of T. parva (r =0.47) and there was no significant difference between age category and percentage positivity of T. parva (p = 0.969). However, there was a relationship between mean number of ticks and farming system (p = 0.019) as well as percentage positivity of T. parva and farming system (p = 0.007)Conclusion: ECF was prevalent in the two farming systems albeit frequent application of acaricides on animals as reported by most of the respondents.

Specifically, the study sought to; identify the missing institutionalized on-campus child care arrangements at the university, establish the dilemmas breast feeding student mothers experience in undertaking the dual roles of mother and student hood due to the missing institutionalized on campus child care arrangements at KyU and examine the effect of the missing institutionalized on campus child care arrangements on undertaking of academic activities by breast-feeding student mothers. A total of 10 breast feeding student mothers were interviewed and data was analyzed using themes. Results indicated that the following institutionalized on-campus child care arrangements were missing at Kyambogo University; adequately furnished baby care rooms, baby playgrounds, immunization and pediatric medical services, professional nannies, child care responsive; teaching time tables, teaching sessions, time frames for course work assignments, tests and examinations’ undertakings, and child care responsive-remedial lessons. Dilemmas of breast feeding student mothers’ in this scenario included choosing between; baby-sitting vs attending lectures, completing a lecture vs breastfeeding a crying hungry baby, undertaking child bonding activities vs undertaking academic activities, completing an exam or a test vs breast feeding a crying hungry baby, baby care vs attending academic group discussion and baby care vs completing a coursework assignment in time. Student mothers at KyU have devised means of coping and have learnt how to resolve the tension of combining motherhood and education in an academic environment without on-campus childcare arrangements so as to pave a brighter career and family future. Such strategies included; receiving child care support from family and student friends, use of privately hired nannies, ignoring one of the two roles, time tabling the activities for the two roles, creating extra time to read, and getting help from spouses. The voices of the interviewees revealed that when the two roles were in conflict, they would rather miss academic activities than abandon their babies especially in critical times like when the babies were sick. It was therefore recommended that KyU considers putting in place various instututionalised on campus arrangements as a critical resource that will enhance academic undertakings of breast-feeding student mothers in their pursuit of Higher Education.",,World Journal of Educational Research,,,2020-08-20,2020,7,3,p87,All OA; Gold,Article,"Opit, Dr Elizabeth; Madinah, Dr Nabukeera; Aisha, Ms. Namubiru","Opit, Dr Elizabeth (); Madinah, Dr Nabukeera (); Aisha, Ms. Namubiru ()",,"Opit, Dr Elizabeth (); Madinah, Dr Nabukeera (); Aisha, Ms. Namubiru ()",0,0,,,http://www.scholink.org/ojs/index.php/wjer/article/download/3159/3188,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130223735,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

The Corona virus Response Team inaugurated a relief food distribution campaign, ensuing from the countrywide COVID-19 lockdown to counter the rising food insecurities in many urban and rural poor households. However, the relief response campaign has received a lot of critics from both rural and urban communities who were planned as the beneficiaries.

5,pub.1130176335,10.3390/sym12081370,,,Recognition of Stator Winding Inter-Turn Fault in Interior-Mount LSPMSM Using Acoustic Signals,"This paper presents a novel stator inter-turn fault diagnosis method for Line Start Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motors (LSPMSMs) using the frequency analysis of acoustic signals resulting from asymmetrical faults. In this method, acoustic data are experimentally collected from a 1 hp interior mount LSPMSM for different inter-turn fault cases and motor loading levels, while including the background noise. The signals are collected using a smartphone at a sampling rate of 48,000 samples per second. The signal for each case is analyzed using fast Fourier transform (FFT), which results in the decomposition of the signal into its frequency components. The results indicate that, for both no-load and full-load conditions, 39 components are observed to be affected by the faults, whereby their amplitudes increase with the fault severity. The 40-turns fault shows the highest difference in the component amplitudes compared with the healthy condition acoustic signal. Therefore, this diagnostic method is able to detect the stator inter-turn fault for interior mount LSPMSMs. Moreover, the method is simple and cheap since it uses a readily available sensor.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by the Deanship of Research at King Fahd University of Petroleum &amp; Minerals (KFUPM), Saudi Arabia, for funding this work through Project No. SR181028.",Symmetry,,,2020-08-01,2020,12,8,1370,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maraaba, Luqman S.; Twaha, Ssennoga; Memon, Azhar; Al-Hamouz, Zakariya","Maraaba, Luqman S.

Uganda as a developing country has put mechanisms in place to provide electricity to her people and be able to realize the national vision of 2040 and be able to address other SDGs by 2030. Solar PV mini-grids are emerging as popular alternatives to address rural electrification shortfall after other renewable energy mini-grid types proved desirable for some period. Uganda's expectations of renewable mini-grids are high with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development, the World Bank, and the Government of Uganda showing much interest to support the mini-grid development. This paper, therefore, looks at general mini-grid development and operation models and finds out arguments making renewable energy mini-grids popular at the expense of non-renewable based mini-grids. The methodology focuses on exploring ideas and formulating a hypothesis by summarizing, categorizing, and interpreting both the primary and secondary data. The paper concludes looking at the strength, benefits, and challenges of renewable mini-grids.","The authors would like to thank the management of the University of Rwanda and in particular, the African Centre of Excellence in Energy for Sustainable Development for the continued support both financially and academically rendered to its students and staff that enable them to carry out research.",,2020 IEEE PES/IAS PowerAfrica,,2020-08,2020,00,,1-5,Closed,Proceeding,"Cartland, Richard; Sendegeya, Al-Mas; de Dieu Khan Hakizimana, Jean","Cartland, Richard (African Center of excellence in Energy for Sustainable Development, College of Science and Technology, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda); Sendegeya, Al-Mas (Department of Electrical Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Technology, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); de Dieu Khan Hakizimana, Jean (African Center of excellence in Energy for Sustainable Development, College of Science and Technology, University of Rwanda, Kigali, Rwanda)",,"Cartland, Richard (University of Rwanda); Sendegeya, Al-Mas (Kyambogo University); de Dieu Khan Hakizimana, Jean (University of Rwanda)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131679005,1605 Policy and Administration; 16 Studies in Human Society,7 Affordable and Clean Energy; 13 Climate Action

The fish is traditionally dried under direct sunshine on bare ground in unhygienic conditions, which expose it to dust and microbiological contamination. In this study, the microbial load of indicator and pathogenic organisms was determined in Mukene sold at selected landing sites of Lake Victoria and Kampala markets, Uganda. A total of 46 samples were collected randomly from landing sites and markets.  The total aerobic counts, total coliforms, Escherichia coli, Salmonella and Staphylococcus aureus were enumerated using standard microbiological methods. The findings showed that Mukene was of low microbial quality for total plate counts, total coliforms, E. coli and S. aureus counts with values ranging from 2.48-8.61 log cfu/g, 0.36-3.09 log MPN/g, 0.36-3.04 log MPN/g and 0.10-6.66 log cfu/g, respectively. Of all samples analyzed, 63% were positive for Salmonella species. As salmonellae and staphylococci are often implicated in incidences of food poisoning, this study suggests that consumption of sun dried Mukene sold at landing sites of Lake Victoria, Uganda, poses a public health concern.

The study sought to analyze the religious explanatory models of pandemics offered by the three major religions of Uganda: Christianity, Islam and African Traditional religious belief system. The COVID-19 pandemic which ravaged the whole world, Uganda inclusive, was used as a case study. Based on a qualitative research process, the study relied on key informant interviews, media reports and online sources of information. It was established that pandemics have been part of human history. Pandemics provide an opportunity for human reflection on transcendent life since they are a challenge to science and human wisdom. Pandemics draw people closer to religion and the spiritual due to the fear, panic, and uncertainty with which they are associated. Religions are left with the responsibility of providing theological answers beyond what human beings can comprehend. The hope and trust that society has in religious institutions make them ultimate institutions to provide solace to millions of people affected with a pandemic for which scientists and politicians have no immediate answers. The study unravels the complementary role that religion and theological studies can make in understanding effective management and prevention of pandemics in society. It also adds to the continuous debate on the relationship between science and religion, arguing for the significance of religious ideas in making science effective enough to combat societal challenges like epidemics.   Key words: Pandemics, religion, religious, construction, disease, Tondism Faith, State, science, traditional healing, coronavirus, Covid-19.",,Journal of African Studies and Development,,,2020-07-31,2020,12,3,77-96,Closed,Article,"Isiko, Alexander Paul","Isiko, Alexander Paul ()",,"Isiko, Alexander Paul ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131568576,22 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 2204 Religion and Religious Studies,

In SME slaughterhouses and butcheries, the risk may be higher due to transmission of foodborne pathogens. This study determined the hygienic practices and microbial quality risk among meat handlers (MH) in SME slaughterhouses and butcheries. Methods Assessment of microbiological quality of beef was carried out at slaughter houses and butcher shops in the districts of Western, Central and Eastern regions of Uganda. A cross sectional study was conducted from June 2017 to January 2018 using observation checklists to record unhygienic practices among the various actors. Microbial load at slaughter and butchery was determined from a total of 317 swab samples collected from carcass, tools, protective clothing and hands of meat handlers. The microbiological quality of beef was evaluated using standard microbiological methods. The samples were inoculated into differential and selective media. Results Butcheries had the highest microbial load on beef carcass ranging from 4.76 log 10 cfu/cm 2 to 7.90 log 10 cfu/cm 2 Total Viable Counts (TVC) while Total Coliform Counts (TCC) ranged from 1.42 log 10 cfu/cm 2 to 3.05 log 10 cfu/cm 2 , E. coli ranged from 0.68 log 10 cfu/cm 2 to 1.06 log 10 cfu/cm 2 and Staphylococcus aureus ranged from 3.25 log 10 cfu/cm 2 to 4.84 log 10 cfu/cm 2 . Salmonella was absent in all the samples analysed. Results of overall microbial quality of beef in Uganda indicated that only TCC (1.60±0.26 log 10 cfu/cm 2 ) of the beef carcass samples at slaughter houses was not significantly above the safe level (p = 0.693). Overall microbial load (TVC, TCC, E. coli and S. aureus ) at butcheries were significantly (p < 0.05) above the safe level. Butcheries of Mbale district had the highest percentage (70%) of beef carcass samples above the TCC safe levels whereas butcheries of Mbarara district had the highest percentage (40%) of beef carcass samples above the E. coli safe levels. TVC from hands and clothes at butchery across the three study districts varied significantly (p=0.007) with the highest counts (7.23 log 10 cfu/cm 2 ) recorded from personnel clothes and lowest (5.46 log 10 cfu/cm 2 ) recorded from hands. On the other hand, swab samples picked from chopping board and working table at the butchery did not show significant variation in TVC, TCC, E. coli and S. aureus microbial loads across the three study districts. Conclusion Hygienic handling of carcasses after slaughter is critical in preventing contamination and ensuring meat safety in informal meat trading sectors in Uganda. Handling practices of beef at Ugandan slaughterhouses and butcheries are not hygienic hence not up to standard and they contribute to microbial contamination of beef posing a risk to consumers.

An explanatory sequential study on midwifery schools in Uganda,"E-learning has become an integral part of mainstream society and hence revolutionizing distance education endeavours. A number of change agents and bureaucrats in Uganda have embraced this pedagogy constructing it as an alternative to the traditional brick and mortar educational systems, which have become difficult to develop and maintain. However, despite the high level of investment on e-learning programs, there is a slow adoption of this new pedagogy amongst students and faculty, and those who do start to use the system opt out later. This trend of slow adoption is likely to constrain government’s efforts of improving the skill mix, competencies and numbers of midwives in the country. This research intended to ascertain whether instructional design was an influencer of e-learning adoption and profile the salient instructional design traits relevant to e-learning adoption in midwifery schools in Uganda. Ten schools were sampled with 224 participants. Data collection was conducted in two phases, the first entailed quantitative data collection and analysis to ascertain whether instructional design played a significant role in e-learning adoption and the second embraced a qualitative data collection and analysis to ascertain the salient traits of instructional design to be relied on by midwifery schools. Simple linear regression analysis established that instructional design had a significant influence on e-learning adoption with p value of (p = 0.016), and it accounted for 38.7% of the variance in e-learning adoption, with a moderate positive relationship and its key salient traits includes: choosing an appropriate instructional design model to guide the entire e-learning process, interactivity of e-learning materials, collaborative working in developing and updating e-learning materials, eliciting feedback on instructional materials, and engaging in more than one e-learning activity.

Elgon, East Africa","Despite the achievements reported from using rainwater harvesting systems, the contribution and drawbacks that affect their usage in mountainous landscapes have received little attention. The uptake and usage of domestic rooftop rainwater harvesting systems (RRWHS) in developing countries is on the increase due to increasing water scarcities. We explored the effect of rainfall variability on water supply and the downsides of using the systems by rural households in Uganda. The objectives were to assess the variability of rainfall (1985-2018), categorise RRWHS used, and examine the influence of slope ranges on the placement of systems and also to quantify the harvested and saved rainwater and establish the factors that affected system usage. Rainfall variability was assessed using a Mann-Kendall test, while system contributions and drawbacks were examined using socioeconomic data. A representative of 444 households were selected using a multicluster sampling procedure and interviewed using semistructured questionnaires. Findings revealed that the months of March, April, September, August, and October experienced an upward trend of rainfall with a monthly coefficient of variation between 41 and 126%. With this, households responded by employing fixed (reinforced concrete tanks, corrugated iron tanks, and plastic tanks) and mobile RRWHS (saucepans, metallic drums/plastic drums, jerrycans, and clay pots). At the high altitude, households deployed mostly plastic jerrycans and industrial plastic/metallic drums to harvest and save water. Overall, the mean annual volume of rainwater harvested on the slopes of Mt. Elgon was 163,063 m3/yr, while the potential to save water ranged from 4% to 7% of the annual household water demand. The factors that hindered the deployment of RRWHS to harvest and save water were high operational costs, price fluctuations, unreliable rainfall pattern, inadequate funds, and limited accessibility. The rainfall received if well-harvested and saved can redeem households of water insecurity, though there is an urgent need of subsidies from the government to increase accessibility of the systems.","The authors thank the support provided by the District Local Government Officials of Mbale, Namisidwa, Manafwa, and Bududa who guided this study through the selection of subcounties for investigation and introduction to community leaders.

This study explored university students’ perceptions of SRH, their source of SRH information and how they authenticated such information in Uganda. Methods: Data were collected from 40 students of Kyambogo university—20 males and 20 females through 4 gender-classified Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Atlas ti 8 software was used to analyse the data and generate themes from interview transcripts.Results: Many students perceived SRH to be about sexual intercourse and its related consequences. Perceived risky behaviours included mainly having multiple sexual partners. The students identified the reduced sexual sensitivity, struggle to bear children in the future, as the myths and misconceptions about different SRH goods and services in addition to the uncertainty over safe days. The various sources of SRH information included Google, social media, health centres, friends, parents and government and non-government organizations. The main barriers to accessing SRH information included lack of finances, inadequate or few medical personnel, and service provider bias.

We executed descriptive analyses for baseline demographic characteristics by intervention, difference in difference (DID), and quantile regression analyses for both primary and secondary outcomes.Results: The median age of participants was 21 years of age, and the majority were female (over 60%), unemployed (over 85%) and Christian (90%). Over 50% were resident in off-campus hostels and in a relationship. Between baseline and end-line, there was a significant increase in SRH knowledge score (DID=2, P<0.001), contraceptive use (DID=6.6%, P<0.05), HIV Voluntary testing and counselling (DID=17.2%, P<0.05), STI diagnosis and treatment (DID=12.9%, P<0.05), and condom use at last sex (DID=4%,P<0.05). There was a significant 0.98 unit increase in knowledge score (adjusted coefficient= 0.98, P<0.001), a significant 1.6-fold increase in odds of contraceptive use (adjusted coefficient= 1.6, P<0.05), a significant 3.5-fold increase in HIV VCT (adjusted coefficient=3.5, P<0.05), and a significant 2-fold increase in odds of STI testing and treatment (adjusted coefficient =1.9, P<0.001) after adjusting for demographic characteristics.Conclusion: A mobile phone application increased sexual and reproductive health information (knowledge score), access to goods (contraceptives), and services (HIV voluntary testing and counseling and sexually transmitted infection diagnosis and management) among sexually active university students in Uganda. Further technical development, including the refinement of youth-friendly attributes, as well as further research into potential economic impact and paths to sustainability, is needed before the app is deployed to the general youth population in Uganda and other low-income settings.

DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a 1:1 cluster-randomised trial with a 6-month nutrition/stimulation/hygiene education intervention among mothers of children aged 6-8 months to improve child development and growth. Development was assessed using Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III (BSID-III) and Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), whereas anthropometry was used to assess growth. Urine iodide concentration (UIC) and urine iodide/creatinine ratio (ICR) were measured.
SETTING: The current study was conducted in southern Uganda.
PARTICIPANTS: We randomly selected 155 children from the 511 enrolled into the original trial and analysed data when they were aged 20-24 and 36 months.
RESULTS: Median UIC for both study groups at 20-24 and 36 months were similar (P > 0·05) and within the normal range of 100-199 µg/l (0·79-1·60 µmol/l), whereas the intervention group had significantly higher ICR at 20-24 months. The BSID-III cognitive score was positively associated (P = 0·028) with ICR at 20-24 months in the intervention group. The ASQ gross motor score was negatively associated (P = 0·020) with ICR at 20-24 months among the controls. ICR was not significantly associated with anthropometry in the two study groups at either time-point.
CONCLUSIONS: Following the intervention, a positive association was noted between ICR and child's cognitive score at 20-24 months, whereas no positive association with ICR and growth was detected.

Identification of individual and community factors associated with HPV vaccination are imperative for directed interventions. Conversely, in most Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) including Uganda this problem has not been sufficiently studied as the influence of individual and contextual determinants remains undetermined in spite of their substantial effect on HPV vaccine uptake. The aim of the study was to identify individual (school attendance status, age of girls, ethnicity, and amount of media exposure) and community (socioeconomic disadvantages) factors associated with HPV vaccination.MethodsBased on a modified conceptual framework for health care utilization, hierarchical modelling was used to study 6093 girls, aged 10–14 years (level 1), nested within 686 communities (level 2) in Uganda by analyzing data from the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey.ResultsMajority (78%) of the girls had not been vaccinated. A number of both individual and community factors were significantly associated with HPV vaccination. The Odds of HPV vaccination were higher among girls age; 11, 13, and 14 compared to girls age 10 years, attending school compared to girls not attending school, who were; foreigners, Iteso, Karamajong, Banyoro, Basoga, and other tribe compared to Baganda, living in families with 1–8 members compared to those living in families with 9 or more members and middle social economic status compared to poor wealth quintile.ConclusionsBoth individual and community factors show a noticeable effect on HPV vaccination. If higher vaccination rates are to be achieved in Uganda, these factors should be addressed. Strategies aimed at reaching younger girls, street children, out of school girls, and girls with lower SES should be embraced in order to achieve high vaccination uptake.","The authors recognize the review comments from Dr Barclay Kieron Research Fellow of Labolatory of Population Health at Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany.The authors are grateful to Measures DHS for permitting us to explore the UDHS dataset.

This article seeks to advance the scope of political agronomy by providing an enhanced framework to link the analysis of agronomic knowledge production to the study of new agricultural technologies in practice. Using case studies of hybrid rice promotion in southern India and western Uganda, the article illustrates the power relations and unanticipated outcomes that accompanied the translation of agronomic research into agrarian settings characterized by pronounced social polarization and marked environmental transformations. These case studies affirm how the starkly uneven outcomes of technological change refract back into the politics of agronomic research and extension as both researchers and policy makers react to the unintended impacts of previous interventions when designing future agendas.",,Development and Change,,,2020-07-10,2020,,,,Closed,Article,"Taylor, Marcus; Bargout, Remy; Bhasme, Suhas","Taylor, Marcus (); Bargout, Remy (); Bhasme, Suhas ()",,"Taylor, Marcus (); Bargout, Remy (); Bhasme, Suhas ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129127868,1606 Political Science; 16 Studies in Human Society,
4,pub.1132037353,10.1016/j.jajp.2020.100035,,,Characteristics of resistance spot welding using annular recess electrodes,"Resistance spot welding is widely used in manufacturing industries, such as automobile structural body manufacture, rail vehicle construction, electronics manufacture, battery manufacture, etc. Resistance spot weld integrity is of paramount importance in the manufacturing industry, especially in automotive body joining to ensure that the automobile bodies can withstand the stress levels that the vehicle is subjected in operation. A number of factors - including electrode geometry, electrode force, welding current and welding time - influence the quality of the resistance spot weld. The electrode material that ensures electrical conductivity and compressive strength and electrode geometry defined by the electrode tip profile, shape, size are important factors in resistance spot welding. This paper discusses the comparative performance of resistance spot welding electrodes with annular recess design and the conventional solid design in welding of a 1 mm thick steel sheet used in construction of automobile structural bodies. The copper-based electrodes used in this study were prepared as described in the ISO 5182:2008 Standard. The annular recess electrode was designed using SolidWorks Version 2015; a hole measuring 4 mm deep and 2.50 mm in diameter was created centrally on the electrode tip and filled with heat resistant mixture of cement and kaolin ceramics. The effects of applied electrode force, current, and weld time on weld-integrity were investigated for the two designs of resistance spot welding electrodes. Linear regression analysis of data obtained established that the weld strength and nugget diameter was higher for the annular recess electrode than the conventional solid electrode. An analysis of variance established that the observed variation of the nugget diameter with weld time was statistically significant but the variations of weld strength with applied electrode force and variation of nugget diameter with current were not statistically significant which may require further study.",,Journal of Advanced Joining Processes,,,2020-07,2020,2,,100035,All OA; Gold,Article,"Watmon, Titus Bitek; Wandera, Catherine; Apora, James","Watmon, Titus Bitek (Department of Mechanical Production Engineering, Kyambogo University, P.O.

Conventional (high-field) MRI scanners are very expensive to purchase, operate and maintain, which limit their use in many developing countries. This study is part of a project that aims at addressing these challenges and is carried out by teams from Mbarara University of Science and Technology (MUST) in Uganda, Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC) in the Netherlands, Delft University of Technology (TU Delft) in the Netherlands and Pennsylvania State University (PSU) in the USA. These are working on developing affordable, portable and low-field MRI scanners to diagnose children in developing countries with hydrocephalus. The challenges faced by the teams are that the low-field MRI scanners currently under development are characterized by low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), and long scan times.MethodsWe propose an algorithm called adaptive-size dictionary learning algorithm (AS-DLMRI) that integrates information-theoretic criteria (ITC) and Dictionary learning approaches. The result of the integration is an adaptive-size dictionary that is optimal for any input signal. AS-DLMRI may help to reduce the scan time and improve the SNR of the generated images, thereby improving the image quality.ResultsWe compared our proposed algorithm AS-DLMRI with adaptive patch-based algorithm known as DLMRI and non-adaptive CSMRI technique known as LDP. DLMRI and LDP have been used as the baseline algorithms in other related studies. The results of AS-DLMRI are consistently slightly better in terms of PSNR, SNR and HFEN than for DLMRI, and are significantly better than for LDP. Moreover, AS-DLMRI is faster than DLMRI.ConclusionUsing a dictionary size that is appropriate to the input data could reduce the computational complexity, and also the construction quality since only dictionary atoms that are relevant to the task are included in the dictionary and are used during the reconstruction. However, AS-DLMRI did not completely remove noise during the experiments with the noisy phantom. Our next step in our research is to integrate our proposed algorithm with an image denoising function.","The authors thank Tom O.

Using a cross-sectional survey design in a study undertaken in Uganda, this chapter investigates the political economy of structural changes affecting the youth in the local labour market as a consequence of globalization. The research reveals how economic reforms have undermined the state’s capacity to create decent employment opportunities, with some results suggesting dire consequences ensuing from global competition, which indicate profound inequality, social exclusion, and extreme poverty. Moreover, prime evidence shows the youth are facing new transitional challenges from training establishments to the labour market as employment opportunities in the country continue to dwindle. This situation is further complicated by demographic realities, which currently indicate that the youth in the working age bracket represent slightly over 30% of the country’s total population, putting a spotlight on the state’s current inability to create youth employment in Uganda’s neoliberal policy context. Findings further emphasize globalization dynamics as constituting the authentication for weakened political structures, which are constrained in a situation that requires urgent response to economic distortions evident in the youth unemployment challenge. The study recommends that the state, taking advantage of isolated supportive market indicators, should spearhead reforms to promote sustainable interventions for correcting the skewed youth unemployment challenge in the local labour market.",,Palgrave Handbooks in IPE,The Palgrave Handbook of African Political Economy,,2020-06-24,2020,,,375-398,Closed,Chapter,"Kanyamurwa, John Mary","Kanyamurwa, John Mary (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Kanyamurwa, John Mary (Kyambogo University)","Kanyamurwa, John Mary (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128714036,1608 Sociology; 14 Economics; 16 Studies in Human Society; 1403 Econometrics; 1605 Policy and Administration; 1402 Applied Economics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities

This paper synthesises literature about the status of the pollutants and their precursors, identifies knowledge gaps and discusses future perspectives on the study of PFASs in Africa. Limited data on PFASs prevalence in Africa is available because there is limited capacity to monitor PFASs in African laboratories. The levels of PFASs in Africa are higher in samples from urban and industrialized areas compared to rural areas. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are the dominant PFASs in human samples from Africa. Levels of PFOS and PFOA in these samples are lower than or comparable to those from industrialized countries. PFOA and PFOS levels in drinking water in Africa are, in some cases, higher than the EPA drinking water guidelines suggesting potential risk to humans. The levels of PFASs in birds' eggs from South Africa are higher, while those in other environmental media from Africa are lower or comparable to those from industrialized countries. Diet influences the pollutant levels in fish, while size and sex affect their accumulation in crocodiles. No bioaccumulation of PFASs in aquatic systems in Africa could be confirmed due to small sample sizes. Reported sources of PFASs in Africa include municipal landfills, inefficient wastewater treatment plants, consumer products containing PFASs, industrial wastewater and urban runoff. Relevant stakeholders need to take serious action to identify and deal with the salient sources of PFASs on the African continent.",,The Science of The Total Environment,,"Alkanesulfonic Acids; Animals; Body Burden; Caprylates; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; South Africa; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2020-06-05,2020,739,,139913,Closed,Article,"Ssebugere, Patrick; Sillanpää, Mika; Matovu, Henry; Wang, Zhanyun; Schramm, Karl-Werner; Omwoma, Solomon; Wanasolo, William; Ngeno, Emily Chelangat; Odongo, Silver","Ssebugere, Patrick (Department of Chemistry, Makerere University, P.O.

This calls for increased understanding of farmers' drought response experiences and perceptions for better agricultural production. This study assessed the smallholder farmers’ perceived evaluation of drought adaptation technologies, constraints and opportunities in drought prone districts of Uganda. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using semi-structured questionnaires. The evaluation indicators of the technologies included efficiency, effectiveness, equity, acceptability, urgency and institutional compatibility performance measures. The findings show that among the irrigation technologies, drip irrigation systems were the most efficient, effective, acceptable and urgent performance measures (p",This study was financially supported by USAID and implemented through FHI 360 and Makerere University Centre for Climate Change Research and Innovations (MUCCRI).

The aim of this study was to determine the proportion of patients with HIV/AIDS within a Ugandan fishing community in the different physical activity (PA) stages. We also explored differences in variables, motives, and barriers for PA across the stages.Methods: In total, 256 individuals (77 men, 40.5 ± 10.3 years) completed the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise Questionnaire, the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depressive symptoms, and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. They were also asked about their most important PA motive and barrier.Results: Seventy-five individuals (29%) were in the (pre-)preparatory stages, 140 (55%) in the action and 41 (16%) in the maintenance stage. Those in the (pre-)preparatory stages had higher PHQ-9 total scores (p < 0.001) and were more likely to report barriers than those in the later stages (p < 0.001). Compared with those in the (pre-)preparatory stage, patients in the action stage experienced less body weakness (p = 0.015).Conclusions: Depression and barriers to PA should be considered in people with HIV/AIDS in low-resource settings when implementing interventions to assist them to become more active.Implications for rehabilitationPeople with HIV/AIDS are among the most physically inactive clinical populations.Clinicians should consider depression when motivating patients with HIV in low resourced settings to become active.Clinicians should consider body weakness when motivating patients with HIV in low resourced settings to become active.",No potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).,Disability and Rehabilitation,,,2020-05-29,2020,,,1-6,Closed,Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Byansi, Peter Kayiira; Namutebi, Hilda; Lillian, Nalukenge; Kinyanda, Eugene; Bbosa, Richard Serunkuma; Ward, Philip B; Lukwata, Hafsa; Mugisha, James","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium.; University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium.); Byansi, Peter Kayiira (Africa Social Development & Health Initiatives, Kampala, Uganda.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Uganda Martyrs University, Kampala, Uganda.); Namutebi, Hilda (Africa Social Development & Health Initiatives, Kampala, Uganda.); Lillian, Nalukenge (Africa Social Development & Health Initiatives, Kampala, Uganda.); Kinyanda, Eugene (Department of Psychiatry, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda.; Mental Health Project, MRC/LSHTM/UVRI and Senior Wellcome Trust Fellowship, Entebbe, Uganda.); Bbosa, Richard Serunkuma (Health Office Buikwe District, Buikwe, Uganda.); Ward, Philip B (School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, Australia.; Ingham Institute of Applied Medical Research, Liverpool, Australia.); Lukwata, Hafsa (Mental Health Unit, Ministry of Health, Kampala, Uganda.); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.; Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.)",,"Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Byansi, Peter Kayiira (Uganda Martyrs University); Namutebi, Hilda (); Lillian, Nalukenge (); Kinyanda, Eugene (Makerere University); Bbosa, Richard Serunkuma (); Ward, Philip B (UNSW Sydney; Ingham Institute); Lukwata, Hafsa (Ministry of Health); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127991703,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

Determinants of nutrition transition in sub-Saharan Africa are presently not well understood. The objective of this review was to synthesise available data on determinants of dietary and physical activity behaviours among women of reproductive age in urban sub-Saharan Africa according to the socio-ecological framework. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science and bibliographies of included articles for qualitative, observational and randomised controlled studies published in English from January 2000 to September 2018. Studies conducted within general populations of women aged 18-49 years were included. Searches were according to a predefined protocol published on PROSPERO (ID = CRD42018108532). Two reviewers independently screened identified studies. From a total of 9853 unique references, twenty-three studies were retained and were mainly from South and West Africa. No rigorous designed quantitative study was identified. Hence, data synthesis was narrative. Notable determinants of dietary behaviour included: convenience, finances, social network, food skills and knowledge gaps, food deserts and culture. Cultural beliefs include strong relationship between high social status and weight gain, energy-dense confectionery, salt or fat-rich foods. Physical activity is influenced by the fast-changing transport environment and cultural beliefs which instigate unfavourable gender stereotypes. Studies with rigorous qualitative and quantitative designs are required to validate and develop the proposed frameworks further, especially within East Africa. Nevertheless, available insights suggest a need for comprehensive skill-based interventions focusing on socio-cultural misconceptions and financial limitations.","We acknowledge Constance Herrebout who identified studies from Scopus database and Merel Leyman, Anke Vandycke, Sigrid Devloo and Diane Berardis for their input in quality assessment.

Trend and variability were assessed using a nonparametric approach based on the cumulative sum of the difference between exceedance and nonexceedance counts of data. Annual and March-May (MAM) rainfall displayed a positive trend (  p < 0.05  ), whereas October-December (OND) and June-September rainfall exhibited negative trends with  p > 0.05  and  p < 0.05  , respectively. Positive subtrends in rainfall occurred in the 1950s and from the mid-2000s till 2016; however, negative subtrends existed between 1960 till around 2005. Seasonal evapotranspiration exhibited a positive trend (  p > 0.05  ). For the entire period (1948–2016), there was no negative subtrend in the OND and MAM evapotranspiration. Rainfall and evapotranspiration trends and oscillatory variation in subtrends over multidecadal time scales indicate the need for careful planning of predictive adaptation to the impacts of climate variability on environmental applications which depend on water balance in the Mpologoma catchment. It is recommended that future studies quantify possible contributions of human factors on the variability of rainfall and evapotranspiration.

A cross sectional survey design using quantitative approach was employed in this study. Data were collected with the help of self-administrated questionnaire from 228 SMEs. Systematic random sampling technique was used. Multiple regression data were analyzed with the help of SPSS software. The results indicated that ecologies of innovation fully mediates the relationship between nexus of generative and entrepreneurial networking. The data was cross sectional in nature, thus limiting monitoring changes in resources accessed from entrepreneurial networks by entrepreneurs over time. The implications are that, policy makers and managers of SMEs should pay more attention to the role of nexus of generative influence in creating ecologies of innovation, conducive environment for employees to interact with mutual influence to advance creativity and innovation that enhance increased access to resources from entrepreneurial networks.

4,pub.1127892869,10.1007/s42108-020-00075-4,,,Suitability of averaged outputs from multiple rainfall-runoff models for hydrological extremes: a case of River Kafu catchment in East Africa,"In this study, seven rainfall-runoff models were applied to model daily River Kafu flows from 1952 to 1981. Among others, models from the rainfall-runoff library of the eWater toolkit were applied. Optimal parameters of each model were obtained based on an automatic calibration strategy. Averaging in terms of simple arithmetic mean, hereinafter taken as the multi-model ensemble (MME), was performed to independently and identically distributed events separately extracted from the outputs of the individual models. How well the MME captured variation and frequency of observed hydrological extremes was assessed. Models performed better for high flows than low flows. Absolute model average biases on quantiles with return periods from 1 to 30 years were over the ranges 5.5–83.6% and 11.6–57.7% for high flows and low flows, respectively. It is envisaged that making model structures flexible and performing calibration with objective functions constrained to extreme events can enhance simultaneous capturing of high flows and low flows. The amount of variance in annual maxima series that could be explained by the multi-model ensemble was 73.4% and ranged from 35.1 to 82.5% for the individual models. This made the multi-model ensemble better than outputs from six of the seven models. For the annual minima flows, the multi-model ensemble yielded the smallest root mean squared error but the third largest coefficient of determination. Notably, the suitability of the multi-model ensemble in capturing the hydrological extremes depends on the selected goodness-of-fit measure, approach for combination of model outputs, number of models considered and length of data used.","The authors are grateful to the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology in Australia for granting access to download the Rainfall Runoff Library.

The method was validated using standard methods of analysis viz: egg albumin precipitation and aluminium colorimetric methods for quantification of tannins and flavonoids respectively. The solvents selected for extraction of dye from plant samples included; distilled water, methanol (5% v/v), ethanol (5% v/v), acidified water pH 3.5 (acidified with acetic acid), and sodium bicarbonate solution (0.1% w/w). Qualitative UV scans were conducted on dye extract of each plant obtained from previously dyed cotton fabrics and wavelengths at maxima for extract of each plant was recorded. In the validation step, data obtained from the modified UV absorbance method were compared to that obtained from standard methods. The modified and validated method was used for the study of extraction output of dye from selected dye-yielding plants using the selected solvents. Extracts from the selected plants registered absorbance maxima at wavelengths unique to each viz: A. coriaria (291 nm), V. paradoxa (294 nm), M.lucida (300 nm) and H. madagascariensis (428 nm) these were employed in setting the analytical instrument. Data obtained from the modified method closely correlated to that from egg albumin and aluminium colorimetric methods with R2 = 0.989 and 0.9258 respectively. The modified method registered minimal errors in the range of (0.3–8.7%) for the A. coriaria extracts and errors of (2.3–6.7%) for M. lucida extracts. The errors recorded from the standard methods were in the range of (2.1–7.9%) and (2.29–6.8%) for egg albumin precipitation and aluminium colorimetric methods respectively. Both the standard and the modified methods exhibited similar accuracy of analysis. Through the application of the modified method, sodium bicarbonate solution (0.1% w/w) was identified to give the best dye extraction output. This modified method gives a faster and cheaper means for quantitative analysis where data is required rapidly for decision making.","Recognition goes to Simon Peter a lab technician at Kyambogo University for his contribution in running the UV spectrophotometer.

This study explored the stakeholders’ perceptions of the community nutrition and dietetics needs, the nature of work done by graduates of the Bachelor’s degree in Human Nutrition/Human Nutrition and Dietetics (HN/HND), and the competencies required of Nutrition and Dietetics professionals in Uganda.Methods: A cross-sectional mixed methods design was used. Respondents included 132 graduates of the Bachelor’s degrees in HN/HND obtained from the Makerere and Kyambogo Universities during the period 2005–2017; 14 academic staff that train HN/HND in the two universities; and 10 HN/HND work/internship supervisors. Data from the graduates was collected through an email-based survey while that from other participants was through face to face interviews using a structured key informant interview guide.Results: Most HN/HND respondents (84.8%) obtained their Bachelor's degrees from Kyambogo University and 61.4% graduated in the years 2013–2017. Most (64.3%) academic staff that responded were females and the majority (57.1%) had doctorate training. All stakeholders viewed communities as facing a variety of nutrition and dietetics challenges some of which fall across different Sustainable Development Goals. The nutrition and dietetics interventions requested, provided, and considered a priority to provide to communities were both nutrition-specific and nutrition-sensitive. Work done by HN/HND graduates encompassed seven main domains; the dominant being organizational leadership and management; management of nutrition-related disease conditions; nutrition and health promotion; research and documentation; and advocacy, communication, and awareness. The knowledge and skills expected of graduates varied but graduates exhibited knowledge and skills gaps in the main areas they are expected to be competent.Conclusions: This study summarises the stakeholders’ perceptions of the nutrition and dietetics challenges faced in Uganda; provided nutrition and dietetic services; nature of work and job roles performed by HN/HND graduates; and the knowledge and skills and related gaps amongst HN/HND graduates practicing in Uganda.

This study aimed to document the quality of malaria case management in private health facilities in nine districts in the Mid-Western region of Uganda, an area of moderate malaria transmission.Methods This was a cross sectional study in which purposive sampling was used to select fifteen private-for-profit facilities from each district. An interviewer-administered questionnaire that contained both quantitative and open-ended questions was used. Information was collected on availability of treatment aides, knowledge on malaria, malaria case management, laboratory practices, malaria drugs stock and data management. We determined the proportion of health workers that adequately provided malaria case management according to national standards.Results Of the 135 health facilities staff interviewed, 61.48% (52.91 - 69.40) had access to malaria treatment protocols while 48.89% (40.19 - 57.63) received malaria training. The majority of facilities, 98.52% (94.75 - 99.82) had malaria diagnostic services and the most commonly available anti-malarial drug was artemether-lumefantrine, 85.19% (78 - 91), followed by Quinine, 74.81% (67 - 82) and intravenous artesunate, 72.59% (64 – 80). Only 14.07% (8.69 – 21.10) responded adequately to the acceptable cascade of malaria case management practice. Specifically, 33.33% (25.46 - 41.96) responded correctly to management of a patient with a fever, 40.00% (31.67 - 48.79) responded correctly to the first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria, whereas 85.19% (78.05 - 90.71) responded correctly to severe malaria treatment. Only 28.83% submitted monthly reports, where malaria data was recorded, to the national database.Conclusion This study revealed sub-optimal malaria case management practices at private health facilities with approximately 14% of health care workers demonstrating correct malaria case management cascade practices. This was due to limited access to malaria case management protocols and guidelines, lack of adequate staff training and supportive supervision, stock-outs of essential anti-malarial commodities and inadequate malaria related community level sensitization. The national malaria control programme could consider this information to inform specific areas of focus for strengthening malaria case management in the private health facilities.",,Research Square,,,2020-05-07,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Wanzira, Humphrey; Tumwine, Daniel; Bukoma, Patrick; Musiime, Allan; Biculu, Juliet; Ediamu, Tom; Gudoi, Samuel; Tibenderana, James; Mulebeke, Ronald; Nantanda, Rebecca; Achan, Jane","Wanzira, Humphrey (Pilgrim Africa, Kampala, Uganda); Tumwine, Daniel (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala,Uganda); Bukoma, Patrick (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Musiime, Allan (Kyambogo University); Biculu, Juliet (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Ediamu, Tom (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Gudoi, Samuel (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Tibenderana, James (Malaria Consortium, Kampala, Uganda); Mulebeke, Ronald (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Nantanda, Rebecca (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda); Achan, Jane (Uganda Pediatrics Association, Kampala, Uganda)",,"Wanzira, Humphrey (); Tumwine, Daniel (); Bukoma, Patrick (Malaria Consortium); Musiime, Allan (Kyambogo University); Biculu, Juliet (); Ediamu, Tom (); Gudoi, Samuel (Malaria Consortium); Tibenderana, James (Malaria Consortium); Mulebeke, Ronald (); Nantanda, Rebecca (); Achan, Jane ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-25796/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127689251,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Furthermore, parental caregiving has also been shown to have an impact on glycaemic control and yet often a gap exists between recommended care and provided care, resulting in failure of children with T1DM meeting their treatment targets. In Uganda, no published study has been conducted to find out if nutrition education has an effect on glycaemic control and caregivers level of knowledge on general and diabetes-specific nutrition for children with T1DM. Methods: The study will be a cluster randomised controlled trial with 10 health facilities randomised to control or intervention at a ratio of 1:1. A total of 100 caregiver-child pairs will be recruited. The participants in the control group will continue to receive routine medical care, while those in the intervention group will receive routine medical care and a nutrition education package. The primary outcome is glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) values. Secondary outcomes will be caregivers level of knowledge on general and diabetes-specific nutrition knowledge, childrens dietary diversity score and childrens mean intake of energy, protein, and fat. Discussion: The findings of this study will be used in improving nutrition education in T1DM among children attending diabetes clinics in Uganda.

Capacity of six CO-ordinated Regional Climate Downscaling EXperiment (CORDEX) Africa Regional Climate Models (RCMs) driven by twenty six Climate Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) General Circulation Models (GCMs) to reproduce the observed ERIs with respect to long-term mean and trends was evaluated. Four RCMs and their five driving GCMs were further analyzed with respect to ERIs. Ensemble means of the RCMs' biases in simulating trends in several ERIs were of magnitudes above 50%. On average, biases in reproducing long-term mean were smaller than those for trends in ERIs. The difference between the performances of RCMs and GCMs depended on the selected RCM–GCM pair. The ensemble means of the RCMs reproduced observed ERIs better than the individual RCMs corroborating that the use of multi-model ensembles can boost credibility of climate change simulations and projections. The RCMs performed better than their driving GCMs in reproducing MDS. The biases of both the RCMs and GCMs were smaller in reproducing the MWS than MDS. Nonetheless, in reproducing observed MWS, the ensemble mean of RCMs' biases was slightly larger than that of the driving GCMs indicating possible adding up of the uncertainties from the GCMs and RCMs. Suggested RCMs' improvements regarding aerosol impacts on rainfall include adding missing constituents (like nitrate), and refining the crudely represented components. RCMs also require high resolution description (in both space and time) of land use types, land surface covers and characteristics as well as landscape heterogeneity. The GCMs to be used as the initial and lateral boundary conditions for the RCMs require improvement in their representation of key dynamical and thermodynamical feedbacks in the Tropical Indian Ocean.",,Climate Dynamics,,,2020-05-01,2020,54,11-12,4841-4864,Closed,Article,"Onyutha, Charles","Onyutha, Charles (Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Kyambogo University, P.O Box 1, Kyambogo, Kampala, Uganda)","Onyutha, Charles (Kyambogo University)","Onyutha, Charles (Kyambogo University)",4,4,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127311502,04 Earth Sciences; 0401 Atmospheric Sciences,13 Climate Action

Plant-based compounds, including essential oils (EOs), as well as their main components, have attracted great interest owing to their known characteristics, such as their antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. These lipophilic compounds, however, need to be incorporated into a delivery system to improve their functionality, application and consumer perception. Many different colloidal systems can be used as promising carriers to deliver EOs to food products. Scope and approach In this review, the current state-of-the-art in the formulation of colloidal delivery systems for food products to encapsulate EOs is reviewed and their pros and cons in terms of formulation and functionality are given. Ultimately, some real food applications of different formulations are introduced. Key findings and conclusions Oil-in-water nanoemulsions and nanoparticles loaded with EOs are the most commonly utilized delivery systems particularly for the food industry. Recent research is more focused on the design of novel carrier systems, including surfactant-based systems, fibers, films, and oleogels. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of research about the physicochemical stability as well as the functionality of delivery systems when they are embedded in a complex matrix of food ingredients. EO-loaded colloidal dispersion has the potential to be efficient partial or complete alternatives for synthetic preservatives depending on the final product, the characteristics of the delivery system, and food regulations.",,Trends in Food Science & Technology,,,2020-05,2020,99,,474-486,Closed,Article,"Doost, Ali Sedaghat; Nasrabadi, Maryam Nikbakht; Kassozi, Vincent; Nakisozi, Henriettah; Van der Meeren, Paul","Doost, Ali Sedaghat (Particle and Interfacial Technology Group (PaInT), Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Gent, Belgium); Nasrabadi, Maryam Nikbakht (Particle and Interfacial Technology Group (PaInT), Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Gent, Belgium); Kassozi, Vincent (Particle and Interfacial Technology Group (PaInT), Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Gent, Belgium); Nakisozi, Henriettah (Department of Food Technology, Faculty of Science, Kyambogo University, Kyambogo, Uganda); Van der Meeren, Paul (Particle and Interfacial Technology Group (PaInT), Department of Green Chemistry and Technology, Faculty of Bioscience Engineering, Ghent University, Coupure Links 653, 9000, Gent, Belgium)","Doost, Ali Sedaghat (Ghent University)","Doost, Ali Sedaghat (Ghent University); Nasrabadi, Maryam Nikbakht (Ghent University); Kassozi, Vincent (Ghent University); Nakisozi, Henriettah (Kyambogo University); Van der Meeren, Paul (Ghent University)",9,9,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125956458,09 Engineering; 0908 Food Sciences,

PET was computed from gridded temperature of the Princeton Global Forcings. Correlation between precipitation or PET and climate indices was analyzed. PET in the Eastern LKB exhibited an increase (p > 0.05). March–April–May precipitation decreased (p > 0.05) in most parts of the LKB. However, September–October–November (SON) precipitation generally exhibited a positive trend. Rates of increase in the SON precipitation were higher in the Eastern part where Mt. Elgon is located than at other locations. Record shows that Bududa district at the foot of Mt. Elgon experienced a total of 8, 5, and 6 landslides over the periods 1818–1959, 1960–2009, and 2010–2019, respectively. It is highly probable that these landslides have recently become more frequent than in the past due to the increasing precipitation. The largest amounts of variance in annual precipitation (38.9%) and PET (41.2%) were found to be explained by the Indian Ocean Dipole. These were followed by precipitation (17.9%) and PET (21.9%) variance explained by the Atlantic multidecadal oscillation, and North Atlantic oscillation, respectively. These findings are vital for predictive adaptation to the impacts of climate variability on water resources.","The authors acknowledge that the CentTrends [30] and Princeton Global Forcing [4] data were used in this study.

The resultant road accident (RA) preventive measures are consequently focused almost solely on individual/team failures at the sharp end of the RTS (mainly the road users). The RTS is complex and therefore cannot be easily understood by studying the system parts in isolation. The study modeled the occurrence of road accidents in Uganda using the dynamic synthesis methodology (DSM). This article presents the work done in the first three stages of the DSM. Data was collected from various stakeholders including road users, traffic police officers, road users, and road constructors. The study focused on RA prevention by considering the linear and non-linear interactions of the variables during the pre-crash phase. Qualitative models were developed and from these, key leverage points that could possibly lower the road accident incidences demonstrating the need for a shared system wide responsibility for road safety at all levels are suggested.",,International Journal of System Dynamics Applications,,,2020-04,2020,9,2,24-41,Closed,Article,"Kizito, Alex; Semwanga, Agnes Rwashana","Kizito, Alex (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Semwanga, Agnes Rwashana (Makerere University College of Computing and Information Sciences, Kampala, Uganda)",,"Kizito, Alex (Kyambogo University); Semwanga, Agnes Rwashana (Makerere University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124479792,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This paper proposes COMPASS, an Indoor Positioning System (IPS) based solution for visually impaired students to move around the university campus independently. COMPASS is a navigation system for the visually impaired students at PMU that consists of three important components which are: an android application running on a smartphone, smart bracelet, and smart shoes. The android application is used to upload student’s class schedule to help them navigate (through Bluetooth based beacons) to and from classes and around the campus. Also, it allows them to call university administrators by simply clicking on a button embedded in the mobile app. The Raspberry Pi based smart bracelet serves as a verification tool (using Tesseract enabled image detection) to ensure that the student arrives at the right class at the right time. As for the smart shoes, it ensures the safety of the student while walking around the campus by detecting obstacles (using ultrasonic sensors) along the way. COMPASS has been extensively tested in a university environment for navigating visually impaired students. COMPASS is economical, small-sized, accurate and uses open source software tools.

The film Framing the Other represents this contact as a destructive force that has not only enabled Mursi women’s victimhood as objects of the tourist gaze, but one that has contributed negative cultural change and loss of tradition. In this article, I provide an alternative, if not oppositional, interpretation that only attends to the nuanced ways Mursi women negotiate cultural loss and change, and recognizes modalities of agential tactics they deploy to negotiate cultural exchange and perform identity work within a cross-cultural contact zone marred with significant inequalities that work to their (dis)advantage. I do not imply that my reading will provide a definitive reading; rather, I reexamine the vanishing tradition and victimhood narratives portrayed in Framing the Other, showing that its multiple layers of meaning in fact motivate an oppositional and alternative reading.",,Ada A Journal of Gender New Media and Technology,,,2020-03-30,2020,2020,16,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Atuhura, Dorothy","Atuhura, Dorothy (Kyambogo University)",,"Atuhura, Dorothy (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.5399/uo/ada.2020.16.2,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132231757,"2002 Cultural Studies; 20 Language, Communication and Culture",

This study developed a novel provitamin A carotenoid (PVAC), iron and zinc rich common bean pumpkin blend (BPB) complementary food (CF) from locally available pumpkin and common bean in Uganda and aimed to determine its acceptance, compared to a control pumpkin blend (PB). Seventy caregivers participated in the study. The sensory attributes (taste, colour, aroma, texture and general acceptability) of BPB and PB were rated using a five-point facial hedonic scale (1 = very bad, 2 = bad, 3 = neutral, 4 = good, 5 = very good). Focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted to assess the perceptions of caregivers about the BPB. The chi square test was used to detect the proportion difference for each sensory attribute between BPB and PB, whilst FGD data were analysed by thematic analysis. A proportion of 64% to 96% of the caregivers rated both BPB and PB as acceptable (good to very good) for all the sensory attributes. There was no significant difference in caregiver acceptability for all attributes between BPB and PB (p > 0.05). Caregivers had positive perceptions about the taste, texture, aroma and colour of the BPB.

It reports preliminary findings from an ongoing Doctoral study on Information Practices of Students with Visual Impairment using Digital Information Resources in Public University Libraries in Uganda. Using a qualitative approach; stratified purposeful, snowball and convenience sampling techniques were used. Data was obtained from twenty visually impaired students using face to face in-depth open ended interviews. Data was analyzed using software Atlas ti v.7.5.5 following the study themes. Findings revealed exclusion in the provision and utilization of assistive technologies in the libraries studied. Skills, competency and capacity constraints by both staff and visually impaired students on the use of assistive technologies, coupled with insufficient assistive technologies impacted on the gainful utilization of digital information resources for academic undertaking. Obsolescence, limited supervisory and technical support from the librarians, and inadequate information, communication and technology (ICT) facilities were major impediments to utilization of assistive technologies to access digital information resources among visually impaired students. Provision of assistive technologies does not guarantee their utilization therefore, the study recommends designing tailor-made courses in ICT for visually impaired students for library staff, equipping visually impaired students with requisite skills and competencies, purchasing or subscribing to up-to-date assistive technologies, acquiring more computers and designating library staff to manage the special needs section in libraries.",,Lecture Notes in Computer Science,Sustainable Digital Communities,,2020-03-19,2020,12051,,470-479,Closed,Chapter,"Agabirwe, Patience; Kiyingi, George W.","Agabirwe, Patience (East African School of Library and Information Science, College of Computing and Information Sciences, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda); Kiyingi, George W.

To assess these spatial variations, this study examined the inundation magnitudes and reflectance of riparian flora in the raining seasons (February-April and September-November) and dry-periods (May-August and December-January). The inundation areas were determined using an object-oriented classification algorithm, whilst the merits concerning the lake, riparian vegetation and shoreline were well-defined using backscatter-coefficient values. Findings indicated that the SAR images are practical to monitor inundation coverages and discern lake basin specific features such as highland areas, shoreline, water and riparian-vegetation. Seasonally, inundated sizes were comparatively higher in February (902 sq.km) and October (700 sq.km). Backscatter values of inundated parts varied from −16 dB to −19 dB, whereas those of riparian vegetation were higher in the months of May and August.

The objective of this study was to explore patients’ and HIV service managers’ perspectives on barriers to implementation of Differentiated ART service delivery in Uganda.MethodsWe employed a qualitative descriptive design involving 124 participants. Between April and June 2019 we conducted 76 qualitative interviews with national-level HIV program managers (n = 18), District Health Team leaders (n = 24), representatives of PEPFAR implementing organizations (11), ART clinic in-charges (23) in six purposively selected Uganda districts with a high HIV burden (Kampala, Luwero, Wakiso, Mbale, Budadiri, Bulambuli). Six focus group discussions (48 participants) were held with patients enrolled in DSD models in case-study districts. Data were analyzed by thematic approach as guided by a multi-level analytical framework: Individual-level factors; Health-system factors; Community factors; and Context.ResultsOur data shows that multiple barriers have been encountered in DSD implementation. Individual-level: Individualized stigma and a fear of detachment from health facilities by stable patients enrolled in community-based models were reported as bottlenecks. Socio-economic status was reported to have an influence on patient selection of DSD models. Health-system: Insufficient training of health workers in DSD delivery and supply chain barriers to multi-month ART dispensing were identified as constraints. Patients perceived current selection of DSD models to be provider-intensive and not sufficiently patient-centred. Community: Community-level stigma and insufficient funding to providers to fully operationalize community drug pick-up points were identified as limitations. Context: Frequent changes in physical addresses among urban clients were reported to impede the running of patient groups of rotating ART refill pick-ups.ConclusionThis is one of the first multi-stakeholder evaluations of national DSD implementation in Uganda since initial roll-out in 2017. Multi-level interventions are needed to accelerate further DSD implementation in Uganda from demand-side (addressing HIV-related stigma, community engagement) and supply-side dimensions (strengthening ART supply chain capacities, increasing funding for community models and further DSD program design to improve patient-centeredness).","Part of the findings documented in this paper were presented at the 17th European AIDS Conference held in Basel, Switzerland between 6 and 9 November 2019 as Abstract PE34/3: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/hiv.12814 The authors gratefully acknowledge Dr. Jepchirchir Kiplagat, Dr. Infante Castañeda Claudia Begoña, and Dr. Svetlana Vladislavovna Doubova for their insightful comments and valuable suggestions on an earlier draft of this paper.

In Uganda, about 32,617 cancer cases were reported in 2018, accompanied by 21,829 deaths. In a view to identify some potential anticancer plant candidates for possible drug development, the current study was designed to compile the inventory of plants with reported anticancer activity used in rural Uganda and the evidences supporting their use in cancer therapy. An electronic survey in multidisciplinary databases revealed that 29 plant species belonging to 28 genera distributed among 24 families have been reported to be used in the management of cancer in Uganda. Anticancer plants were majorly from the families Bignoniaceae (7%), Caricaceae (7%), Fabaceae (7%), Moraceae (7%), and Rutaceae (7%). Most species occur in the wild (52%), though some are cultivated (48%). The growth habit of the plants is as trees (55%) or herbs (45%). Anticancer extracts are usually prepared from leaves (29%), bark (24%), roots (21%), and fruits (13%) through decoctions (53%), as food spices (23%) or pounded to produce ointments that are applied topically (10%). Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman, Opuntia species, Albizia coriaria (Welw. ex Oliver), Daucus carota L., Cyperus alatus (Nees) F. Muell., Markhamia lutea (Benth.) K. Schum., and Oxalis corniculata L. were the most frequently encountered species. As per global reports, Allium sativum L., Annona muricata L., Carica papaya L., Moringa oleifera Lam., Opuntia species, Prunus africana (Hook.f.) Kalkman, and Catharanthus roseus (L.) G. Don. are the most studied species, with the latter having vincristine and vinblastine anticancer drugs developed from it. Prostate, cervical, breast, and skin cancers are the top traditionally treated malignancies. There is a need to isolate and evaluate the anticancer potential of the bioactive compounds in the unstudied claimed plants, such as Cyperus alatus (Nees) F. Muell., Ficus dawei Hutch., Ficus natalensis Hochst., and Lovoa trichilioides Harms, and elucidate their mechanism of anticancer activity.","TO, DMN, PN, LNK, AJ, AM, BJK, IM, CKN, and MKC are grateful to the World Bank and the Inter-University Council of East Africa for the scholarship awarded to them through the Africa Center of Excellence II in Phytochemicals, Textiles, and Renewable Energy (ACE II PTRE) hosted at Moi University that prompted this concerted ethnomedical communication.

The aim of this study was to develop a fine-scaled copy number variation map for African goats. We used sequence data from multiple breeds and from multiple African countries. ResultsA total of 253,553 CNV (244,876 deletions and 8,677 duplications) were identified, corresponding to an overall average of 1,393 CNV per animal. The mean CNV length was 3.3 kb, with a median of 1.3 kb. There was substantial differentiation between the populations for some CNV, suggestive of the effect of population-specific selective pressures. A total of 6,231 global CNV regions (CNVR) were found across all animals, representing 59.2 Mb (2.4%) of the goat genome. About 1.6% of the CNVR were present in all 34 breeds and 28.7% were present in all 5 geographical areas across Africa, where animals had been sampled. The CNVR had genes that were highly enriched in important biological functions, molecular functions, and cellular components including retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, glutamatergic synapse and circadian entrainment. ConclusionsThis study presents the first fine CNV map of African goat based on WGS data and adds to the growing body of knowledge on the genetic characterization of goats.",,Research Square,,,2020-03-03,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Nandolo, Wilson; Mészáros, Gábor; Wurzinger, Maria; Banda, Liveness J.; Gondwe, Timothy N.; Mulindwa, Henry A.; Nakimbugwe, Helen N.; Clark, Emily L.; Woodward-Greene, M.

2,pub.1125475731,10.3390/w12030705,,,Combined Use of Graphical and Statistical Approaches for Analyzing Historical Precipitation Changes in the Black Sea Region of Turkey,"Many statistical methods have been developed and used over time to analyze historical changes in hydrological time series, given the socioeconomic consequences of the changes in the water cycle components. The classical statistical methods, however, rely on many assumptions on the time series to be examined such as the normality, temporal and spatial independency and the constancy of the data distribution over time. When the assumptions are not fulfilled by the data, test results are not reliable. One way to relax these cumbersome assumptions and credibilize the results of statistical approaches is to make a combined use of graphical and statistical methods. To this end, two graphical methods of the refined cumulative sum of the difference between exceedance and non-exceedance counts of data points (CSD) and innovative trend analyses (ITA)-change boxes alongside the classical statistical Mann–Kendall (MK) method are used to analyze historical precipitation changes at 16 stations during 1960–2015 in the Black Sea region of Turkey. The results show a good match between the results of the graphical and statistical methods. The graphical CSD and ITA methods, however, are able to identify the hidden trends in the precipitation time series that cannot be detected using the statistical MK method.",,,,,2020-03-01,2020,12,3,705,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cengiz, Taner Mustafa; Tabari, Hossein; Onyutha, Charles; Kisi, Ozgur","Cengiz, Taner Mustafa (Civil Engineering Department, Hydraulics Division, Namik Kemal University, 59860 Tekirday, Turkey;, tcengiz@nku.edu.tr); Tabari, Hossein (Department of Civil Engineering, KU Leuven University, 3000 Leuven, Belgium); Onyutha, Charles (Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Kyambogo University, P.O.

This study aimed to evaluate the impact of dietary practices on disease cases and the various factors that contribute to diseases among children below five years in households Nangabo, Wakiso district-Uganda. This was a cross-sectional descriptive study. A total of 100 households with children below five years were randomly selected from the different villages of Nangabo sub-county. The study found out that 54% of households (HHs) had 3–5 members, 72% headed by fathers, 56% of HHs heads were in business and transport, and 88% had 1–2 children below five years. All HHs had toilets, but 90% did not have tip water taps for washing hands after using the toilet, 62% had proper sanitation, and 82% got water from taps and tanks. 34% of HHs had children falling sick monthly, where 84% of them had children affected by flu, cough, and malaria. 90% of HHs purchased food, 54% had 3 meals a day, and 60% did not separate children's food when cooking. However, 95% of those who separately cooked children's food used boiling and steaming as primary cooking methods. 58% of HHs had children fed by themselves, but only 4% had children sharing plates, and 84% had a daily dietary-diversity score of 3/6 and above. There was a negative correlation between HHs daily dietary-diversity score and the incidence of diseases among children, −0.06 (0.66), although it was not statistically significant.

Lactobacillus species have been shown to reduce aflatoxin contamination during the process of food fermentation. Twenty-three Lactobacillus strains were isolated from fecal samples obtained from a cohort of rural Ugandan children at the age of 54 to 60 months, typed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and characterized in terms of their ability to bind aflatoxin B1 in vitro. Evidence for chronic exposure of these children to aflatoxin B1 in the study area was obtained by analysis of local foods (maize flour and peanuts), followed by the identification of the breakdown product aflatoxin M1 in their urine samples. Surprisingly, Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota of 140 children from the same cohort at 24 and 36 months showed the highest positive correlation coefficient with stunting among all bacterial genera identified in the stool samples.

Novel homemade CFs rich in vitamin A, iron and zinc need to be developed, and assessed for their acceptability among target children. Objective Homemade provitamin A carotenoid (PVAC), iron and zinc-rich complementary food (CF), common bean pumpkin blend (BPB) formulated from pumpkin ( Sweet cream ) and common bean ( Obwelu ) and PVAC-rich pumpkin blend (PB) from Sweet cream were prepared by expert peer mothers. This study compared child acceptability of BPB and PB (control). Methods The cross-over acceptability study randomly assigned Ugandan children 6 to 24 months old to either receive 100g of BPB (n=35) or 100g of PB (n=35) on day one. After a washout period of one day, children crossed over to receive either BPB (n=35) or PB (n=35). The amount of CF consumed, duration of consumption, and micronutrient intake were assessed. CF was acceptable if children consumed ≥ 50g (50%) of served food (100g). A paired t-test was used to determine the mean differences within participants between BPB and PB. Results The mean consumption of BPB and PB was 53.9g and 54.4g, respectively. The mean duration for consumption of BPB and PB was 20.6 and 20.3 minutes, respectively. There was no significant difference in amounts consumed, and duration of consumption in BPB and PB (P>0.05). The mean intake of vitamin A was significantly higher (P<0.00001) in PB (152.5 µgRAE) compared to BPB (100.9 µgRAE). The mean iron intake was significantly higher in BPB (1.1mg) (P<0.00001) compared to BP (0.3mg). Furthermore, zinc intake was significantly higher (P<0.00001) in BPB (0.58mg) compared to BP (0.13mg). Conclusion A homemade CF, BPB, made from locally available common bean and pumpkin is rich in PVAC, iron and zinc and is acceptable to children in the age range of complementary feeding in Uganda.",,Research Square,,,2020-02-28,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Buzigi, Edward; Pillay, Kirthee; Siwela, Muthulisi","Buzigi, Edward (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Pillay, Kirthee (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Siwela, Muthulisi (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",,"Buzigi, Edward (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Pillay, Kirthee (University of KwaZulu-Natal); Siwela, Muthulisi (University of KwaZulu-Natal)",1,1,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-15355/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125300320,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1114 Paediatrics and Reproductive Medicine,
2,pub.1125281143,10.21203/rs.2.18363/v3,,,Understanding implementation barriers in the national scale-up of Differentiated ART delivery in Uganda,"Background Although Differentiated Service Delivery (DSD) for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been rolled-out nationally in several countries since World Health Organization (WHO)’s landmark 2016 guidelines, there is little research evaluating post-implementation outcomes. The objective of this study was to explore patients’ and HIV service managers’ perspectives on barriers to implementation of Differentiated ART delivery in Uganda. Methods We employed a qualitative descriptive design involving 124 participants. Between April and June 2019 we conducted 76 qualitative interviews with national-level HIV program managers (n=18), District Health Team leaders (n=24), representatives of PEPFAR implementing organizations (11), ART clinic in-charges (23) in six purposively selected Uganda districts with a high HIV burden (Kampala, Luwero, Wakiso, Mbale, Budadiri, Bulambuli). Six focus group discussions (48 participants) were held with patients enrolled in DSD models in case-study districts. Data were analyzed by thematic approach as guided by a multi-level analytical framework: Individual-level factors; Health-system factors; Community factors; and Context. Results Our data shows that multiple barriers have been encountered in DSD implementation. Individual-level: Individualized stigma and a fear of detachment from health facilities by stable patients enrolled in community-based models were reported as bottlenecks. Socio-economic status was reported to have an influence on patient selection of DSD models. Health-system: Insufficient training of health workers in DSD delivery and supply chain barriers to multi-month ART dispensing were identified as constraints. Patients perceived current selection of DSD models to be provider-intensive and not sufficiently patient-centred. Community: Community-level stigma and insufficient funding to providers to fully operationalize community drug pick-up points were identified as limitations. Context: Frequent changes in physical addresses among urban clients were reported to impede the running of patient groups of rotating ART refill pick-ups. Conclusion This is one of the first multi-stakeholder evaluations of national DSD implementation in Uganda since initial roll-out in 2017. Multi-level interventions are needed to accelerate further DSD implementation in Uganda from demand-side (addressing HIV-related stigma, community engagement) and supply-side dimensions (strengthening ART supply chain capacities, increasing funding for community models and further DSD program design to improve patient-centeredness).",,Research Square,,,2020-02-26,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY; Rujumba, Joseph; Kwiringira, Japheth; Katureebe, Cordelia; Spicer, Neil","ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University College of Health Sciences); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (Republic of Uganda Ministry of Health); Spicer, Neil (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Department of Global Health and Development)",,"ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (); Spicer, Neil ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-8984/v3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125281143,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

Effective supply chain regulations on dispensing and stock control are important for controlling this epidemic. Since compliance with these regulations in resource-limited countries is poor, there is need to understand its predictors in order to reduce the risk of prescription drug use disorders.MethodsA mixed-methods study utilizing a structured questionnaire and a simulated client guide was undertaken in Kampala and Mbale towns in Uganda. The questionnaire recorded self-reported dispensing and verified stock control practices and their covariates from 101 private pharmacies. The guide recorded actual dispensing practices from 27 pharmacies. Snowball sampling was done to enrich the sample with pharmacies that stock opioids. The mean compliance with good dispensing and stock control practices was calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of compliance.ResultsThe mean compliance with dispensing and stock control requirements was 82.9% and 23%, respectively. Twenty percent and 40% of the pharmacies dispensed pethidine without a prescription and with invalid prescriptions, respectively. Having a pharmacist on duty (OR = 5.17; p = 0.02), prior in-service training on narcotics regulations (OR = 3.51; p = 0.04), and previous narcotics audits by the regulator (OR = 5.11; p = 0.01) were independent predictors of compliance with stock control requirements. Pharmacies with a previous history of poor compliance with dispensing requirements were less likely to demonstrate good compliance (OR = 0.21; p = 0.01).ConclusionsThere is suboptimal compliance to controlled prescription drug regulations among Uganda’s pharmacies. A previous history of poor compliance to dispensing requirements predicted low compliance in subsequent assessments. Training and regulatory audits increased compliance in stock control but not dispensing. Expansion of training and audits to more pharmacies and/or incentives for compliance are necessary.","We thank the following research assistants who participated in data collection: Irene Kantono, Sarah Nabwami, Peter Kageni, Martin Omachar, Robert Biibi, and Annet Nannyonga.

Snakebites are poorly documented in Uganda because most occur in rural settings where traditional therapists end up being the first-line defense for treatment. Ethnobotanical surveys in Uganda have reported that some plants are used to antagonize the activity of various snake venoms. This review was sought to identify antivenin plants in Uganda and some pharmacological evidence supporting their use. A literature survey done in multidisciplinary databases revealed that 77 plant species belonging to 65 genera and 42 families are used for the treatment of snakebites in Uganda. The majority of these species belong to family Fabaceae (31%), Euphorbiaceae (14%), Asteraceae (12%), Amaryllidaceae (10%) and Solanaceae (10%). The main growth habit of the species is shrubs (41%), trees (33%) and herbs (18%). Antivenin extracts are usually prepared from roots (54%) and leaves (23%) through decoctions, infusions, powders, and juices, and are administered orally (67%) or applied topically (17%). The most frequently encountered species were Allium cepa, Carica papaya, Securidaca longipedunculata, Harrisonia abyssinica, and Nicotiana tabacum. Species with global reports of tested antivenom activity included Allium cepa, Allium sativum, Basella alba, Capparis tomentosa, Carica papaya, Cassia occidentalis, Jatropa carcus, Vernonia cinereal, Bidens pilosa, Hoslundia opposita, Maytensus senegalensis, Securinega virosa, and Solanum incanum.

2,pub.1124690438,10.21203/rs.2.18363/v2,,,Understanding implementation barriers in the national scale-up of Differentiated ART delivery in Uganda,"Background: Although Differentiated Service Delivery (DSD) for anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has been rolled-out nationally in several countries since World Health Organization (WHO)’s landmark 2016 guidelines, there is little research evaluating post-implementation outcomes. The objective of this study was to explore patients’ and HIV service managers’ perspectives on barriers to implementation of Differentiated ART service delivery in Uganda.Methods: We employed a qualitative descriptive design involving 124 participants. Between April and June 2019 we conducted 76 qualitative interviews with national-level HIV program managers (n=18), District Health Team leaders (n=24), representatives of PEPFAR implementing organizations (11), ART clinic in-charges (23) in six purposively selected Uganda districts with a high HIV burden (Kampala, Luwero, Wakiso, Mbale, Budadiri, Bulambuli). Six focus group discussions (48 participants) were held with patients enrolled in DSD models in case-study districts. Data were analyzed by thematic approach as guided by a multi-level analytical framework: Individual-level factors; Health-system factors; Community factors; and Context.Results: Our data shows that multiple barriers have been encountered in DSD implementation. Individual-level: Individualized stigma and a fear of detachment from health facilities by stable patients enrolled in community-based models were reported as bottlenecks. Socio-economic status was reported to have an influence on patient selection of DSD models. Health-system: Insufficient training of health workers in DSD delivery and supply chain barriers to multi-month ART dispensing were identified as constraints. Patients perceived current selection of DSD models to be provider-intensive and not sufficiently patient-centred. Community: Community-level stigma and insufficient funding to providers to fully operationalize community drug pick-up points were identified as limitations. Context: Frequent changes in physical addresses among urban clients were reported to impede the running of patient groups of rotating ART refill pick-ups. Conclusion: This is one of the first multi-stakeholder evaluations of national DSD implementation in Uganda since initial roll-out in 2017. Multi-level interventions are needed to accelerate further DSD implementation in Uganda from demand-side (addressing HIV-related stigma, community engagement) and supply-side dimensions (strengthening ART supply chain capacities, increasing funding for community models and further DSD program design to improve patient-centeredness).",,Research Square,,,2020-02-06,2020,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY; Rujumba, Joseph; Kwiringira, Japheth; Katureebe, Cordelia; Spicer, Neil","ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University College of Health Sciences); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (Republic of Uganda Ministry of Health); Spicer, Neil (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Department of Population Health)",,"ZAKUMUMPA, HENRY (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (); Spicer, Neil ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-8984/v2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124690438,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

Recent studies suggest that the lack of skills to use mobile devices is a substantial barrier in the adoption and diffusion of mobile financial services. How inhabitants of developing countries learn skills is largely unknown. We present a field-study of learning mobile money skills using a sample of the Ugandan population. The study sample consists of 208 inhabitants from an urban area, and 526 inhabitants from a rural area. The data shows that in both studies, learning is better explained by social network characteristics compared to attributes of the individual. In particular, individuals' profit from people in their network if those network connections are skillful, regardless of how skilled the learner is. Our results suggest that on top of this direct learning effect, learning happens at an accelerated rate in networks that consist of skilled people. Comparing the rural and urban sample, we find that network effects are more substantial in the rural area relative to the urban area. The results further reveal that individuals with higher education and better mobile phone skills are less dependent on their networks in learning how to use mobile money.",The authors thank two anonymous reviewers for the helpful comments and recommendations on improving the structure and content of this research.,Computers in Human Behavior,,,2020-02,2020,103,,214-225,Closed,Article,"Kiconco, Rebecca I.; Rooks, Gerrit; Snijders, Chris","Kiconco, Rebecca I.

Compared to age at first marriage and contraceptive use, age at sexual debut and family size preferences are rarely examined in studies of fertility decline. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of age at first marriage, age at first sex, family size preferences and contraceptive use to change in fertility in Uganda between 2006 and 2016.MethodsUsing data from the 2006 and 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS), we applied a nonlinear multivariate decomposition technique to quantify the contribution of age at first marriage, age at first sex, family size preference and contraceptive use to the change in fertility observed during the 2006–2016 period.ResultsThe findings indicate that 37 and 63% of the change in fertility observed between 2006 and 2016 was respectively associated with changing characteristics and changing fertility behavior of the women. Changes in proportion of women by; age at first marriage, age at first sex, family size preferences and contraceptive use were respectively associated with 20.6, 10.5 and 8.4% and 8.2% of the change in fertility but only fertility behavior resulting from age at first sex was significantly related to the change in fertility with a contribution of 43.5%.ConclusionsThe study quantified the contribution of age at first marriage, age at first sex, family size preferences and contraceptive use to the change in fertility observed between 2006 and 2016. We highlight that of the four factors, only age at sexual debut made a significant contribution on the two components of the decomposition. There is need to address the low age at first sex, accessibility, demand for family planning services and youth-friendly family planning services to young unmarried women such that they can achieve their desired fertility. The contribution of other factors such as education attainment by women and place of residence and their relationship with changes in fertility calls for addressing if further reduction in fertility is to be realised.",The authors thank Measure DHS for granting permission to use the UDHS data.,BMC Women's Health,,Adolescent; Contraception Behavior; Family Characteristics; Family Planning Services; Female; Fertility; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Marriage; Needs Assessment; Reproductive Health; Sexual Behavior; Uganda,2020-01-16,2020,20,1,8,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ariho, Paulino; Kabagenyi, Allen","Ariho, Paulino (Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, P.O.

Aflatoxins remain a scourge in the country, unprecedentedly reducing the nutritional and economic value of agricultural foods. This review was sought to synthetize the country's major findings in relation to the mycotoxins' etiology, epidemiology, detection, quantification, exposure assessment, control, and reduction in different matrices. Electronic results indicate that aflatoxins in Uganda are produced by Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus and have been reported in maize, sorghum, sesame, beans, sunflower, millet, peanuts, and cassava. The causes and proliferation of aflatoxigenic contamination of Ugandan foods have been largely due to poor pre-, peri-, and postharvest activities, poor government legislation, lack of awareness, and low levels of education among farmers, entrepreneurs, and consumers on this plague. Little diet diversity has exacerbated the risk of exposure to aflatoxins in Uganda because most of the staple foods are aflatoxin-prone. On the detection and control, these are still marginal, though some devoted scholars have devised and validated a sensitive portable device for on-site aflatoxin detection in maize and shown that starter cultures used for making some cereal-based beverages have the potential to bind aflatoxins. More efforts should be geared towards awareness creation and vaccination against hepatitis B and hepatitis A to reduce the risk of development of liver cancer among the populace.","The authors are grateful to the World Bank and the Inter-University Council of East Africa for the scholarship awarded to Timothy Omara and Winfred Nassazi through the Africa Center of Excellence II in Phytochemicals, Textiles and Renewable Energy (ACE II-PTRE) at Moi University that made them realize this communication.",International Journal of Microbiology,,,2020-01-07,2020,2020,,4723612,All OA; Gold,Article,"Omara, Timothy; Nassazi, Winfred; Omute, Tom; Awath, Aburu; Laker, Fortunate; Kalukusu, Raymond; Musau, Bashir; Nakabuye, Brenda Victoria; Kagoya, Sarah; Otim, George; Adupa, Eddie","Omara, Timothy (Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, School of Biological and Physical Sciences, Moi University, Uasin Gishu County, Kesses, P.O.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the psychometrical properties of the OPQoL-brief questionnaire among cognitively intact nursing home residents. The research question addressed evidence related to the dimensionality, reliability and construct validity, all of which considered interrelated measurement properties.MethodsCross-sectional data were collected during 2017–2018, in 27 nursing homes representing four different Norwegian municipalities, located in Western and Mid-Norway. The total sample comprised 188 of 204 (92% response rate) long-term nursing home residents who met the inclusion criteria: (1) municipality authority’s decision of long-term nursing home care; (2) residential time 3 months or longer; (3) informed consent competency recognized by responsible doctor and nurse; and (4) capable of being interviewed.ResultsPrincipal component analysis and confirmative factor analyses indicated a unidimensional solution. Five of the original 13 items showed low reliability and validity; excluding these items revealed a good model fit for the one-dimensional 8-items measurement model, showing good internal consistency and validity for these 8 items.ConclusionFive out of the 13 original items were not high-quality indicators of quality-of-life showing low reliability and validity in this nursing home population. Significant factor loadings, goodness-of-fit indices and significant correlations in the expected directions with the selected constructs (anxiety, depression, self-transcendence, meaning-in-life, nurse-patient interaction, and joy-of-life) supported the psychometric properties of the OPQoL-brief questionnaire. Exploring the essence of quality-of-life when residing in a nursing home is highly warranted, followed by development and validation of new tools assessing quality-of-life in this population. Such knowledge and well-adapted scales for the nursing home population are beneficial and important for the further development of care quality in nursing homes, and consequently for quality-of-life and wellbeing in this population.","The authors acknowledge the nursing home residents who voluntarily participated in this study, and the research assistants Eva Rinnan, Brit Moene Kuven, Wenche Mjanger Eide, and Siw Eriksen Taasen who collected the data.",Health and Quality of Life Outcomes,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Male; Norway; Nursing Homes; Principal Component Analysis; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2020-01-02,2020,18,1,1,All OA; Gold,Article,"Haugan, Gørill; Drageset, Jorunn; André, Beate; Kukulu, Kamile; Mugisha, James; Utvær, Britt Karin S.","Haugan, Gørill (NTNU Center for health promotion research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway; Faculty of Nursing and Health Sciences, Nord University, Bodø, Norway); Drageset, Jorunn (Faculty of Health and Social Science, Western University of Applied Science, Bergen, Norway; University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway); André, Beate (NTNU Center for health promotion research, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Trondheim, Norway); Kukulu, Kamile (Faculty of Nursing, Akdeniz University, Antalya, Turkey); Mugisha, James (Social Worker, Kyambogo University and Butabika National Referral and Teaching Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); Utvær, Britt Karin S.

Although Uganda's ministry of health recommends screening for women aged 25-49 years, the screening remains low even in the most developed region (Central Uganda) of the country. This study examined the demographic, social, and economic predictors of cervical cancer screening in Central Uganda with the aim of informing targeted interventions to improve screening. The cross-sectional survey was conducted in Wakiso and Nakasongola districts in Central Uganda. A total of 845 women age 25-49 years participated in the study. Data were analyzed at bivariate and multivariate levels to examine the predictors of CC (cervical cancer) screening. Only 1 in 5 women (20.6%) had ever screened for cervical cancer. Our multivariate logistic regression model indicated that wealth index, source of information, and knowledge about CC and CC screening were significantly associated with cervical cancer screening. The odds of cervical cancer screening were higher among rich women compared with poor women [AOR = 1.93 (95%CI: 1.06-3.42), p = 0.031)], receiving information from health providers compared with radios [AOR = 4.14 (95%CI: 2.65-6.48), p<0.001, and being more knowledgeable compared with being less knowledgeable about CC and CC screening [AOR = 2.46 (95%CI: 1.49-3.37), p<0.001)]. Overall cervical cancer screening uptake in central Uganda was found to be low. The findings of the study indicate that women from a wealthy background, who had been sensitized by health workers and with high knowledge about CC and CC screening had higher odds of having ever screened compared with their counterparts. Efforts to increase uptake of screening must address disparities in access to resources and knowledge.","This work was funded by the Germany Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) (https://www.daad.de) funding program in-country/ in-region scholarship program Uganda 2016 under grant number 57299305 and awarded to IA.

Fifty-nine Lactobacillus isolates were cultured from the outer crust, blue veins and white core of the cheese and were speciated phenotypically and by 16S rDNA sequence analysis. Lactobacillus plantarum was the dominant species detected with only two isolates identified as Lactobacillus brevis. Strains were typed by pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using the enzyme NotI to examine their genomic diversity. Cluster analysis of PFGE patterns produced five major clusters which associated isolates with their sites of isolation within the cheese. One L. plantarum isolate from each cheese site was selected and evaluated for salt, acid, relative humidity, and heat tolerance to determine whether stress conditions within the isolation site selected their phenotype. D 72°C values were 6, 13, and 17 s for strains from the crust, veins and core, respectively, suggesting strains on the crust may not have been able to survive pasteurization and therefore had been added post-pasteurization. All strains recovered from heat injury within 24-48 h at 4°C. pH values of 3, 3.5, and 4 suppressed growth but strains showed a varying ability to grow at pH 4.5 and 5; isolates from the core (which has the lowest pH) were the most acid-tolerant. All strains grew at 3.5 and 5% salt but were suppressed at 10%; those from the crust (which has a lower water activity) were the most halo-tolerant, growing at 8% salt whereas strains from the core were sensitive to this salt concentration. All 57 L. plantarum isolates were examined for antimicrobial activity and variable activity against Lactobacillus pentosus and other genera was demonstrated; plantaricin EF genes were present in 65% of strains. It was concluded that there are varied phenotypes and genotypes of Lactobacillus in a Stilton cheese according to site of isolation. Occurrence of different L. plantarum genotypes could contribute to variation in the cheese quality from batch to batch and provides criteria for selecting isolates as potential adjunct cultures.","The content of this work first appeared in the thesis by DM (2013) titled ‘characterisation of the Non-starter Bacterial Flora of Stilton Cheese’ which represents the only medium it has appeared in, in line with the University of Nottingham policy, and can be accessed online.

Empirical evidence from Sub-Saharan Africa,"This study examines whether the relationship between exports and productivity growth differs across firm size. Using panel data from three Sub-Saharan African countries, I use propensity score matching procedure to examine this relationship. This study finds evidence of productivity differences between new exporters and non-exporters confirming the empirical regularity that new exporters are more productive than never exporters. The findings indicate that export participation effects vary across firm size, with both small and large firms experiencing immediate and significant productivity gains upon entry. However, the productivity gain for large firms is highly significant and more pronounced in the first two years after entry but declines drastically from the third year and tends towards negative in subsequent years. Learning effects might be important for large firms during the initial years of exporting, but these effects dissipate once learning avenues have been exhausted. Small firms display sustained learning effects that expand beyond the fourth year. Relative to the large firms, small new exporters display sustained and significant productivity growth for five year. This study finds no evidence of cumulative productivity growth beyond the third year for large firms. These results are robust to alternative measure of productivity. Any export-led growth should be directed at helping small new exporters access the export markets.",,Cogent Economics & Finance,,,2020-01-01,2020,8,1,1754150,All OA; Gold,Article,"Esaku, Stephen; Nsiah, Christian","Esaku, Stephen (Department of Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Nsiah, Christian (Baldwin Wallace University, USA)",,"Esaku, Stephen (Kyambogo University); Nsiah, Christian (Baldwin–Wallace College)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2020.1754150,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126808911,1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

We find that education level matters in the selection of enterprises. The bulk of businesses, like eating kiosks, fish selling, shoe shining among others that require no specialized skill to operate were mainly run by primary school dropouts and those with no formal level of education. Furthermore, we find evidence of a strong entrepreneurial spirit among secondary school dropouts than at any other education level. Across all businesses surveyed, secondary school dropouts run a high number of informal enterprises. Evidence suggests that their motivation is driven by two key factors, namely, wanting to take advantage of an existing business opportunity and failure to find employment in the formal sector. The empirical results show that access to finance, crime, theft and disorder, electricity, water, taxes, burdensome inspections, and informal gifts are robust and significant obstacles to the operations of the informal sector in Uganda. Policies should focus on a regulatory framework that supports the sector to create secure livelihoods and generate employment opportunities for the unemployed rather than viewing the sector as a source of “illegality.” Improving access to finance, providing regular power and water supply, and improving the tax regime would mitigate the obstacles faced by informal businesses leading to possible formalization. Informal sector businesses should not be perceived as “illegal entities” but rather complementary effort by an increasingly enterprising population in the country.","The authors declare no potential conflict of interest in this research, authorship, or publication of this paper.",Cogent Economics & Finance,,,2020-01-01,2020,8,1,1843255,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mugoda, Salmon; Esaku, Stephen; Nakimu, Rose Kibuka; Bbaale, Edward","Mugoda, Salmon (Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University , Kampala, Uganda); Esaku, Stephen (Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University , Kampala, Uganda); Nakimu, Rose Kibuka (Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University , Kampala, Uganda); Bbaale, Edward (Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University , Kampala, Uganda)",,"Mugoda, Salmon (Kyambogo University); Esaku, Stephen (Kyambogo University); Nakimu, Rose Kibuka (Kyambogo University); Bbaale, Edward (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2020.1843255,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132365116,"1503 Business and Management; 15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

Using a unique dataset from the Kenyan manufacturing sector, we examine this question using ordinary least squares method and feasible generalized least squares technique. We find simultaneous high rates of job creation and job destruction. In most cases, job creation in the manufacturing sector was not adequate to offset the rapid destruction of jobs. Second, we find that the presence of simultaneously high rates of job creation and job destruction cut across firm size and age. Third, we find that young firms account for almost all of the net job creation rates implying that the firm’s age is important in shaping its contribution to net job creation rates. Our findings have practical implications. First, job creation policies alone without policies that mitigate the destruction of jobs created might not be successful. For job creation to be successful in the manufacturing sector, effort should be made towards developing strategies that mitigate the destruction of jobs created. This is because job creation and destruction rates simultaneously follow each other. Second, to expand employment growth, effort should be dedicated to supporting young firms (6–10 years), through possibly, tax relief, providing technology of production or any possible government subsidy that can help these firms grow and survive in the turbulent business environment.",,Cogent Economics & Finance,,,2020-01-01,2020,8,1,1782113,All OA; Gold,Article,"Esaku, Stephen","Esaku, Stephen (Department of Economics and Statistics, Kyambogo University , Uganda, Box 810, Soroti, Uganda)",,"Esaku, Stephen (Kyambogo University)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/23322039.2020.1782113,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128750662,"1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics; 1503 Business and Management; 15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

This study analyzed phenological dynamics in a savannah dominated semi-arid environment of Uganda. We used moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index (MODIS NDVI) imagery. TIMESAT program was used to analyse the imagery to determine key phenological metrics; onset of greenness (OGT), onset of greenness value, end of greenness time (EGT), end of greenness value, maximum NDVI, time of maximum NDVI, duration of greenup (DOG) and range of normalized difference vegetation index (RNDVI). Results showed that thicket and shrubs had the earliest OGT on day 85 ± 14, EGT on day 244 ± 32 and a DOG of 158 ± 25 days. Woodland had the highest NDVI value for maximum NDVI, OGT, EGT, and RNDVI. In the bushland, OGT occurs on average around day 90 ± 11, EGT on day 255 ± 33 with a DOG of 163 ± 36 days. The grassland showed that OGT occurs on day 96 ± 13, EGT on day 252 ± 36 with a total DOG of 156 ± 33 days. Early photosynthesis activity was observed in central to eastern Karamoja in the districts of Moroto and Kotido. There was a positive relationship between rainfall and NDVI across all vegetation cover types as well as between phenological parameters and season dynamics. Vegetation senescence in the sub-region occurs around August to mid-September (day 244–253). The varied phenophases observed in the sub-region reveal an inherent landscape heterogeneity that is beneficial to extensive pastoral livestock production.

In the current study, the heavy metal content of water and edible muscles of a piscivorous fish (Protopterus annectens) as well as bioaccumulation of the heavy metals in fish tissues were evaluated. Samples of water (n = 6) and fish (n = 6) were taken from Kirinda bridge and Ruliba station on Nyabarongo river and analyzed by UV spectroscopy and atomic absorption spectrometry, respectively. The heavy metal concentrations in water were: iron (0.63 ± 0.02 and 1.61 ± 0.03 mg/kg), manganese (0.53 ± 0.002 mg/kg at Ruliba station), chromium (0.06 ± 0.002 mg/kg at Kirinda bridge), cadmium (0.106 ± 0.002 mg/kg at Ruliba station) and lead (0.75 ± 0.02 and 0.051 ± 0.01 mg/kg).

A Cross-Sectional Survey Among Three Universities,"BACKGROUND.COVID-19 is an emerging and a highly infectious disease that is becoming a global health challenge affecting all sectors. With an aim of preventing COVID-19 transmission, all education institutions were closed and advised to turn to online learning. The present study sought to determine the factors affecting the acceptance and use of electronic learning among Ugandan University students in three universities.METHODSThe study relied on two data collection instruments: questionnaire and semi-structured interview. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted on a population of students in three pre-selected universities: Kyambogo, Makerere and Kampala International University. The students aged 18 and above constituted the study. The online questionnaire was sent to participants through WhatsApp Messenger and E-mails and a total of 614 questionnaires were returned. 15 participants were involved in the semi-structured interview. All analyses were performed using STATA 15.1 and Microsoft office Excel 2016.RESULTS. Of the 614 questionnaires returned, 578 were valid. Majority of the respondents were males (n = 378, n = 65.4%). 60.7% were from Makerere University and majority being in their third year of study (n = 283, n = 49.0%). Overall, 69.2% (n = 400) had good knowledge, 22.5% (n = 130) had good/positive attitudes toward e-learning. Factors associated with knowledge were place of residence (p = 0.023) and gender (p = 0.025). Factors associated with attitudes were age (p = 0.021) and place of residence (p = 0.000). The semi-structured interviews revealed connectivity and skills challenges as the main barriers for implementation of e-learning.CONCLUSIONFor better implementation of e-learning by Universities, effective planning needs to be done with active students’ involvement to avert the negative attitudes.

This study explored spatial patterns of NS using spatial-temporal methods to establish its clustering patterns across both space and time. Village and year of NS onset for individual patients between the years 1990 and 2014 were entered as input for spatial and temporal analysis in the 6 districts in northern Uganda where it is prevalent. Our temporal results showed that NS onset started before the population was moved in Internally Displaced People’s (IDPs) camps. It also shows that NS continued to be reported during the IDPs and after people had left the IDPs. Our spatial and spatiotemporal analysis showed that two periods had persistent NS clusters. These were 2000-2004 and 2010-2014, coinciding with the period when the population was in the IDP camps and when the population was already out of the camps, respectively.

Seeing as the COVID-19 crisis affected finances, stress, and time perceptions, changes regarding planning, selecting, and preparing healthier foods were evaluated in 38 countries worldwide. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey using validated instruments (N=37 207, M age 36·7 SD 14·8, 77% women) was conducted in 38 countries between April 14th and June 25th 2020. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses were used to assess the influence of psychological distress, financial stress, and perceptions of time availability, alongside economic and social restrictions, on self-perceived changes in planning, selecting, and preparing healthier foods. Analyses were run separately for men and women, weighted by country, and controlled for sociodemographic variables. Findings: Small increases ( p< 0·0001) in planning (4·7 SD 1·3, 4.9 SD 1·3), selecting (3·6 SD 1·7, 3·7 SD 1·7), and preparing (4·6 SD 1·2, 4·7 SD 1·3) healthier foods were found for women and men. Perceived time availability and working from home were associated with positive changes ( p< 0·0001). Psychological distress acted as a barrier for women, and an enabler for men ( p< 0·0001). Financial distress acted as a barrier and enabler for men and women, depending on other sociodemographic variables ( p< 0·0001).Interpretation: Food literacy improvement is possible worldwide. At the onset of the COVID-19 crisis, perceptions of greater time availability and working from home related to increases in planning, selecting, and preparing healthier foods. Psychological distress and financial stress were barriers and enablers to food literacy.

The sample comprised 527 undergraduate Teacher Education students (Mean age ​= ​22 years; SD ​= ​2.20) randomly selected from seven universities in Uganda. Data were collected using the modified Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire. These profiles included the following; (a) high self-regulated learners (252 students; 47.8%), (b) average self-regulated learners (209 students; 39.7%), and (c) low self-regulated learners (66 students; 12.5%) who differed significantly with respect to their motivational beliefs. Additionally, motivational beliefs significantly predicted latent profile membership. It is, therefore, important to understand such profiles’ differences among Teacher Education students in order to improve on their self-regulated learning strategies. Implications of the study findings are further discussed in this paper.","Funding: The first author was supported with funding from the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) under Section 413 - Eastern and Southern Africa (Grant numbers 91560707/A/14/93426 and A/14/93426) to conduct his doctoral studies.

2,pub.1130363363,10.4236/abb.2020.118028,,,The Bioprocessing Quick Wins from Avocado Fruit in Uganda,"Bioprocessing can help redeem the economic value for avocado (Persea americana) in Uganda. This study reviews the virgin potential of avocado bioprocessing in Uganda. Avocado consists of flesh, seed, and peel. The review indicates that the waste seed and peel are vital for development of high-value products. Both the edible part and waste (peel and seed) can be used for biogas production through a solid-state fermentation process. Biodiesel can be developed using avocado seed oil through a process called transesterification. Avocado oil is a better alternative for biodiesel production compared to waste cooking oil as it requires no further conversions processes for transforming fatty acids to esters. The starch-rich avocado seed is a suitable substrate for bioethanol, pigment and starch production. The high starch content places the avocado fruit as a potential: 1) raw material for the production of bioplastics; 2) substrate for bacterial culture media production as opposed to potatoes, cereals, and cassava that double as a staple food. Avocado seeds can also be used for the production of antioxidants relevant for preventing enzymatic browning, thereby increasing product shelf life. Despite the quick wins, there is a need for increased research, financing, personnel training and development of appropriate policies to spur the benefits and untapped potential of avocado bioprocessing in Uganda. The circular economy of avocado waste alone into high-value products could increase gains in the environment and stimulate industrial development, especially the cosmetic, food and pharmaceutical industries in Uganda.",,Advances in Bioscience and Biotechnology,,,2020,2020,11,8,405-419,All OA; Gold,Article,"Baidhe, Emmanuel; Kiggundu, Nicholas; Banadda, Noble","Baidhe, Emmanuel (); Kiggundu, Nicholas (); Banadda, Noble ()",,"Baidhe, Emmanuel (); Kiggundu, Nicholas (); Banadda, Noble ()",0,0,,,http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=102520,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130363363,09 Engineering; 0904 Chemical Engineering,

However, organic waste from Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) may contain contaminants that are harmful to public health and the environment. This study determined the heavy metal concentration in MSW in Kampala City, Uganda. Also, the physicochemical properties of briquettes produced from the MSW were compared with charcoal. The waste samples were collected from residential, institutional and market areas over a period of two weeks. They were then analyzed for the presence of heavy metals. Briquettes were made from the bio-waste and were subjected to calorific and proximate analysis. Results indicated that the mean concentrations of Cd, Cr, Cu, Fe, and Pb were 1.25 mg/kg, 2.04 mg/kg, 38.2 mg/kg, 3.97 mg/kg and 1.99 mg/kg respectively while Hg was not detected. The calorific values of briquettes ranged from 8.9 to 15.3 MJ/kg and were lower than those of charcoal. Heavy metal concentrations in bio-waste collected were below the permissible acceptable limits.

In this paper, we analyze the electrical defects in a CMOL circuit including open and bridge. A parallel March-like test algorithm is presented for the CMOL architecture, which covers the faults caused by the open and bridge defects and parametric variations during its fabrication. Analysis results show that the test time of the proposed test algorithm is reduced significantly compared with the enhanced methods of March-MOM and March C* for CMOL architectures. The write time is reduced approximately 5n/4x and nx, respectively, where n is the number of memristors attached to a nanowire segment. The read time is also reduced drastically. Finally, a design for testability (DFT) architecture is proposed to adapt the parallel March-like test algorithm. In compare with the short write time testing scheme, the proposed DFT can achieve 35.4% of reduction in area overhead, with 14.52% more power overhead kept the same delay in a CMOL circuit with 64 memory cells.",,IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computing,,,2020,2020,PP,99,1-1,Closed,Article,"Liu, Peng; You, Zhiqiang; Wu, Jigang; Elimu, Michael; Wang, Weizheng; Cai, Shuo; Han, Yinhe","Liu, Peng (School of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, 47870 Guangzhou, Guangdong China 510006 (e-mail: liupeng@gdut.edu.cn)); You, Zhiqiang (College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, 12569 Changsha, Hunan China (e-mail: you@hnu.edu.cn)); Wu, Jigang (School of Computer, Guangdong University of Technology, 47870 Guangzhou, Guangdong China (e-mail: asjgwucn@outlook.com)); Elimu, Michael (College of Computer Science and Electronic Engineering, Hunan University, 12569 Changsha, Hunan China (e-mail: elimumichael@hnu.edu.cn)); Wang, Weizheng (College of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, 12418 Changsha, Hunan China (e-mail: greaquer_w@yeah.net)); Cai, Shuo (School of Computer and Communication Engineering, Changsha University of Science and Technology, 12418 Changsha, Hunan China (e-mail: caishuo@csust.edu.cn)); Han, Yinhe (Institute of Computing Technology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, Beijing China 100190 (e-mail: yinhes@ict.ac.cn))",,"Liu, Peng (Guangdong University of Technology); You, Zhiqiang (Hunan University); Wu, Jigang (Guangdong University of Technology); Elimu, Michael (Hunan University); Wang, Weizheng (Changsha University of Science and Technology); Cai, Shuo (Changsha University of Science and Technology); Han, Yinhe (Institute Of Computing Technology)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126062484,08 Information and Computing Sciences; 0803 Computer Software,

We built up the education for the students as a “learning-pattern” of different kinds of dialogue. As method, we employed a questionnaire, which the students filled in at the end of the project. We found many examples of how individual reading and listening on the one hand, and collective writing and group discussion on the other hand interacted with each other and thereby increased student learning and engagement.

The article has a vocational pedagogical/vocational didactic focus where work processes are the starting point for vocational education and training. The article’s contribution to the vocational pedagogical field documents Ugandan work life’s strong need for closer collaboration between companies and education, and that educational institutions must be action-oriented. The second result is the further development of known tools and combinations of these for use in the implementation of vocational pedagogy and action research projects.",,,"Aksjonsforskning i Norge, volum 2: Grunnlagstenkning, forskerroller og bidrag til endring i ulike kontekster",,2020,2020,,,541-572,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Sannerud, Arne Ronny","Sannerud, Arne Ronny ()",,"Sannerud, Arne Ronny ()",0,0,,,https://press.nordicopenaccess.no/index.php/noasp/catalog/view/121/603/4452-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134150063,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,4 Quality Education

Bidragsytere er forskere som har lang erfaring med å kombinere praksisutvikling og kunnskapsutvikling i aksjonsforskningsprosjekter. Flere av artiklene retter søkelyset mot det epistemologiske og metodologiske grunnlaget i aksjonsforskning og dilemmaer knyttet til forskerrollen. Spørsmål som gjelder aksjonsforskningens hensikt, metoder for endring og hva slags kunnskap som skal utvikles og dokumenteres av og for hvem blir diskutert. Noen av artiklene utforsker utfordringer som handler om grunnleggende verdier, makt, demokrati og dialog i aksjonsforskning. Artiklene gir også eksempler på hvordan aksjonsforskning kan gjennomføres i ulike kontekster. Noen handler om å forske i egen praksis, eventuelt sammen med kolleger, studenter eller andre samarbeidspartnere. Det er også eksempler som viser hvordan forskere ved universiteter og høgskoler blir invitert inn i pågående forbedringsarbeid, for eksempel i skoler, helseinstitusjoner, kommuner og bedrifter. Forskerne bidrar på ulike måter med å fasilitere utviklingsprosessen, med faglige innspill og med dokumentasjon. Å kombinere utvikling og forskning krever uansett kontekst at forskere redegjør for sin posisjon og i samarbeid med deltakerne avklarer hvilke roller eller funksjoner deltakerne skal ha og hva som er målet med utviklingen og forskningen. Et viktig anliggende i antologien er å få fram at aksjonsforskning som samarbeidende forskning nødvendigvis vil innebære dilemmaer knyttet til makt, verdier og ulike syn på kunnskap.

The aim is to investigate perspectives, principles and dilemmas concerning the purpose of action research, development methods, the role of the researcher and the epistemological basis. The analysis sheds light on important dilemmas to which there are various answers. There are different views on the extent to which the purpose of action research is to develop and document knowledge for practitioners or for academia. A major methodological challenge is about the distribution of power and balance between participant influence and research management. An important dilemma is whether the researcher should be internal or external in relation to the context in question. One important epistemological issue concerns the potential of action research to transcend established traditions and structures. Another is whether democratic participation is an end in itself.

Hvordan bidra til profesjonalisering innenfra?,"In this article, we focus on the teacher educator’s role in school-based competence development by asking: How can the teacher educator contribute to professionalization from within? The term “professionalization from within” describes how teachers and school leaders should be complementing governmental development strategies by actively pursuing local school development, managing norms and standards, and developing a local, professional knowledge base. The article presents a study based on data from a four-year action research project at a Norwegian primary school where Lesson Study (LS) was put into use as a vehicle for school-based competence development. Through the research question “How did teacher educators contribute to professionalization from within?” and the use of open coding in the constant comparative analysis method (Strauss & Corbin, 1998), three main categories were developed: emotional support, organizational support and process support. “Emotional support” shows teacher educators empowering the practitioners as owners of the development work, appreciating their knowledge and work, inviting them to cogenerative learning and challenging them in supportive ways. “Organizational support” shows teacher educators cooperating with school leaders to establish predictable but flexible structures and leadership for holistic school-based competence development. “Process support” shows research and process-oriented teacher educators contributing to the development of collective research and development skills and strengthening the learning and development processes by introducing LS and other process tools and by combining internal knowledge, research and external knowledge.

Through UiU, we have worked with school development in six municipalities, where we have facilitated future stories or scenarios in the process of helping schools to reflect on their devlopement. In order to study the schools work on improvement, our study illustrates how scenario narratives can be used as a method to promote involvement, collective learning and contribute to school development. Six different scenario stories based on three different theories formed the basis of the participants’ discussion and reflections on the improvement work. Each theory forms the basis for a success narrative and a failure narrative around the implementation of UiU. The topic of the article is: In what ways can scenarios be used as a method for developing schools? We find that use of scenarios help both teachers and school leaders thinking outside the box.

The main argument is that students outside the traditional profession-oriented educational programs in health, social work and teacher education training curriculums, such as master-level students in innovation and knowledge development studies, need practical experiences in real-time interactions with regional actors. Practical experiences are in-the-moment practices constructed in dialogues between actors with different interests and knowledge. Within the research, the aim was to design a course where students and regional actors are both participants and co-learners. As co-learners, it is necessary for students to develop process awareness. The research question is: how is process awareness constructed between students and regional actors? A theoretical grounding for building process awareness is to create learning arenas with specific purpose and democratic dialogue in which to develop process awareness. The key findings from our action research dialogues are: i) the uniqueness of real-life challenges experienced in the co-creation processes with regional actors is difficult to replicate in the classroom (on campus); specifically, relational tensions and/or conflicts-of-interest can only be witnessed real-time, ii) the need to make explicit the time dimension of the co-creation process, and iii) the need to make explicit the evolving (unfinished) work in the co-creation process.",,,"Aksjonsforskning i Norge, volum 2: Grunnlagstenkning, forskerroller og bidrag til endring i ulike kontekster",,2020,2020,,,463-485,All OA; Gold,Chapter,"Karlsen, James","Karlsen, James ()",,"Karlsen, James ()",0,0,,,https://press.nordicopenaccess.no/index.php/noasp/catalog/view/121/603/4452-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134158713,1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education,

The aim is partly to describe and analyse how dialogue as a concept is understood and used in action research, and partly to discuss how this analysis can inform future action research. We find that in action research, dialogue is used both to express features of collaborative relations and as a theoretical concept with an analytical function. This makes it possible to describe an interface between action research and dialogical practice which is illustrated by a model with two crossing axes. One axis illustrates a continuum from the procedural to the substantial, from an emphasis on rules for ‘doing’ to emphasis on content and ways of ‘knowing’. The other axis illustrates a continuum from individual ability and participation to collective commitment. Together these two crossing axes form a matrix that can be used for analysing the use and signinficance of ‘dialogue’ as a concept in action research.

It also explores the marketing strategies and the students’ selection process, providing theoretical and practical insights into education marketing in Africa. In particular, it focuses on the competition for students. The growing number of student enrolments, the public sector’s inability to meet the ever-increasing demands and new private universities springing up mean that it is essential for universities to identify their market and effectively communicate their messages. Although there has been substantial theoretical research to help shed light on students’ choices and universities' marketing strategies, little work has been undertaken on higher education in the African context. Filling that gap in the research, while at the same time acknowledging the regional differences in Africa, this book offers empirical insights into the higher education market across the continent.

A close-ended questionnaire was administered to top and middle level university managers (n = 101) to establish the status quo of strategic human resource management practices and the perceived role it can play to alleviate inefficient management at Makerere and Kyambogo. The results of the study indicate that strategic human resource management practices are barely practiced in Uganda public universities. The results also reveal that top and middle level managers have a strong conviction that integration of strategic human resource management practices can alleviate inefficient management in Uganda public universities. The paper concludes that due to rapid changes emanating from globalisation, knowledge based economy, technological revolution and reduced funding of higher education from governments, public universities in Uganda need to adopt strategic human resource management to improve their efficiency",,West East Journal of Social Sciences,,,2019-12-19,2019,8,1,122-132,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kasule, George Wilson; Bisaso, Ronald","Kasule, George Wilson (); Bisaso, Ronald ()",,"Kasule, George Wilson (); Bisaso, Ronald ()",1,1,,,https://www.weijournals.com/index.php/WEJSS/article/download/14/14,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123590935,"1503 Business and Management; 15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services",

Studies on fertility in Uganda have focused on the overall fertility in the country. In this study, we focus on determinants of change in fertility among rural women in Uganda using a multivariate Poisson decomposition technique to quantify the contribution of changes in the socioeconomic and demographic composition of women which we also refer to as the characteristic effects and changes in their fertility behavior (the coefficients' effects or risk of childbearing) to the overall reduction in fertility among women in rural areas during the 2006-2016 period. The ""characteristics effects"" are used to mean the effect of changing composition of women by the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics between 2006 and 2016. On the other hand, fertility behavior also presented as coefficients' effects mean changes in the risk or likelihood of giving birth to children by the rural women between the two survey years. Our findings indicate that the mean number of children ever born (MCEB) reduced from 4.5 to 3.9 in 2006 and this reduction was associated with both the changes in composition of women and fertility behavior. The composition of women contributed to 42% while the fertility behavior contributed to 58% of the observed reduction. The education level attained and the age at first sex showed significant contributions on both components of the decomposition. The observed decline in fertility is largely associated with the variation in the risk of childbearing among the rural women. The variation in the risk of childbearing by education and age at first sex of the rural women showed to be the biggest contribution to the observed change in fertility. Continued improvements in access, attendance, and completion of secondary schools by women in rural areas will be the key drivers to Uganda's overall transition to low fertility. Furthermore, with improved access to mass media in the rural areas, there can be changes in attitudes and large family size preferences which can create a conducive environment for the utilization of family planning services in the rural communities. Efforts should therefore focus on applying appropriate methods to deliver packaged family planning messages to these communities.",The authors thank Measure DHS for granting permission to access and use the UDHS data.,Journal of Pregnancy,,Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Birth Rate; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fertility; Health Surveys; Humans; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Rural Population; Socioeconomic Factors; Uganda; Young Adult,2019-12-19,2019,2019,,6429171,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ariho, Paulino; Nzabona, Abel","Ariho, Paulino (Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, Uganda.); Nzabona, Abel (Department of Population Studies, School of Statistics and Planning, Makerere University, Uganda.)","Ariho, Paulino (Kyambogo University)","Ariho, Paulino (Kyambogo University); Nzabona, Abel (Makerere University)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1155/2019/6429171,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123539032,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

However, child-focused pedagogies are rare. The case is made that child-led research is an appropriate model for developing inclusive classroom practice. This research is the first to consider the relationship between Ugandan teachers’ epistemological beliefs and child-led research. The findings from questionnaire responses of 187 teachers and educators challenge the argument that Ugandan teachers’ epistemological beliefs are the primary barrier to implementing child-focused pedagogies and indicate that a child-led research initiative would complement the epistemological beliefs of many teachers and offer a potential model for an inclusive pedagogical approach.",No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.,International Journal of Disability Development and Education,,,2019-12-10,2019,,,1-16,Closed,Article,"Sheehy, Kieron; Kasule, George Wilson; Chamberlain, Liz","Sheehy, Kieron (Professor of Education (Innovation Pedagogies), The Open Unversity – ECYS, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Correspondencekieron.sheehy@open.ac.uk); Kasule, George Wilson (Educational Planning and Management, Kyambogo University Ringgold standard institution, Kampala, Uganda); Chamberlain, Liz (Department of Education, The Open Unversity – ECYS, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland)",,"Sheehy, Kieron (); Kasule, George Wilson (Kyambogo University); Chamberlain, Liz ()",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1123257421,1302 Curriculum and Pedagogy; 13 Education,

The objective of this study was to explore patients’ and HIV service managers’ perceptions of the early implementation experiences of national DSD roll-out across Uganda. Methods We utilized a qualitative research design involving 124 participants. Between April and June 2019 we conducted 76 semi-structured interviews with national-level HIV program managers (n=18), District Health Team leaders (n=24), representatives of PEPFAR implementing organizations (11), ART clinic in-charges (23) in six purposively selected Uganda districts with a high HIV burden (Kampala, Luwero, Wakiso, Mbale, Budadiri, Bulambuli). Six focus group discussions (48 participants) were held with patients enrolled in DSD models in case-study districts. Data were analyzed by thematic approach as guided by the multi-level analytical framework by Levesque et al. (2013): Individual-level factors; Health-system factors; Community factors; and Context. Results Our data shows that multiple barriers have been encountered in DSD implementation. Individual-level factors: Individualized stigma and a fear of detachment from health facilities by stable patients enrolled in community-based models were reported as bottlenecks. Socio-economic status was reported to have an influence on patient selection of DSD models. Health-system factors: Insufficient training of health workers in DSD delivery and supply chain barriers to multi-month ART dispensing were identified as constraints. Patients perceived current selection of DSD models to be provider-intensive and not sufficiently patient-centred. Community factors: Community-level stigma and insufficient funding to providers to fully operationalize community drug pick-up points were identified as limitations. Contextual factors: Frequent changes in physical addresses among urban clients were reported to impede the running of patient groups of rotating drug pick-ups. Conclusion This is one of the first multi-stakeholder evaluations of national DSD implementation in Uganda since initial roll-out in 2017. Multi-level interventions are needed to accelerate further DSD implementation in Uganda from demand-side (addressing self-stigma barriers, community engagement) and supply-side dimensions (strengthening ART supply chain capacities, increasing funding for community models and further DSD program design to improve patient-centeredness).",,Research Square,,,2019-12-07,2019,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Zakumumpa, Henry; Rujumba, Joseph; Kwiringira, Japheth; Katureebe, Cordelia; Spicer, Neil","Zakumumpa, Henry (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University College of Health Sciences); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (Republic of Uganda Ministry of Health); Spicer, Neil (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Department of Population Health)",,"Zakumumpa, Henry (Makerere University); Rujumba, Joseph (Makerere University); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Katureebe, Cordelia (); Spicer, Neil ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-8984/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126259170,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This cross-sectional study investigated the test-retest reliability of the 2-min walk test (2MWT) and its concurrent validity with the 6-min walk test (6MWT) in Ugandan patients with depression. We also explored practice effects and assessed the minimal detectable change (MDC) and clinical correlates with the 2MWT.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study executed in Butabika National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda. Fifty Ugandan patients with depression (15 women; median age = 29.0 years) performed twice a 2MWT, once a 6MWT, and completed the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ), and Brief Symptoms Inventory-18 (BSI-18).
RESULTS: The median (interquartile) 2MWT score on the first and second test were 125.5 (59.2) meters and 131.0 (57.0) meters (p = .28). The intraclass correlation was.96 (95% confidence interval [0.94, 0.98]). The MDC was 23.5 m for men and 23.4 m for women. There was no evidence of a practice effect. Scores on BSI-18 depression, SIMPAQ walking, and SIMPAQ incidental physical activity explained 66.3% of 2MWT score variance.
CONCLUSION: The 2MWT is a reliable test, which can be conducted without any special equipment or substantial time demands, to provide a valid assessment of the functional exercise capacity in outpatients with depression.",This project was funded by Geestkracht VZW.

Assessment of quality of participation in farmer learning video production in central Uganda,"Purpose: This study assessed the quality of participation in farmer learning video (FLV) production by examining opportunities for actors’ participation and the extent of incorporation of their interests. Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative case study research design was used through focus group discussions and interviews held with 5 key informants and 19 farmers involved in the production of 2 videos. We used the quality of participation analytical framework for analysis. Findings: Actors in FLV production were largely selected basing on interests and expertise in carrying out assigned tasks. The extent of actor participation in FLV production varied. Video experts made major decisions on video content and allocation of tasks while field officers and farmers largely participated in the filming stage. The incorporation of farmers’ interests was curtailed by their limited participation in planning for FLV production. Further, farmers and field officers perceived that inadequate communication between and among them limited their contributions to FLV production. Practical implications: Choice of actors with the right expertise and providing opportunities for interactions of individual expertise to generate video content is essential. Further, effective communication among actors is important for enhancing actors’ contributions and incorporation of their interests especially at the planning stage. Theoretical implications: Participation of end-users in product development should not only focus on their participation but also on the quality of that participation. Originality/value: Many developing countries have incorporated use of videos in agricultural development initiatives thereby necessitating the production of quality FLVs.",The authors are appreciative of Access Agriculture for funding this research and Kyambogo University for supporting the Ph.D. study for which the research is part of.

Human health risk assessment from consumption of contaminated fish and yams as well as contact with contaminated sediments from the stream were performed. Forty-eight (48) samples of water (n = 12), sediments (n = 12), fish (n = 12) and yams (n = 12) were taken at intervals of 10 m from three gold recovery sites located at up, middle and down sluices of the stream and analyzed for total mercury (THg) using US EPA method 1631. Results (presented as means  ±  standard deviations) showed that water in the stream is polluted with mercury in the range of < detection limit to 1.21  ±  0.040 mg/L while sediments contain mean THg from < detection limit to 0.14  ±  0.040 ugg-1.

The mean THg content of the sediments, edible muscles of O. nilotica and D. alata were within acceptable WHO/US EPA limits. About 91.7% of the water samples had mean THg above US EPA maximum permissible limit for mercury in drinking water. Consumption of D. alata grown within 5 m radius up sluice of Namukombe stream may pose deleterious health risks as reflected by the health risk index of 0.985 being very close to one. From the pollution and risk assessments, mercury use should be delimited in Syanyonja artisanal gold mining areas. A solution to abolish mercury-based gold mining in the area needs to be sought as soon as possible to avert the accentuating health, economic and ecological disaster arising from the continuous discharge of mercury into the surrounding areas.

We also explored whether there was a practice effect, determined minimal detectable changes (MDC) and assessed which factors are associated with the 2MWT performance. Fifty outpatients [22 women; 33.5 (14.3) years] performed the 2MWT twice and the 6MWT once and completed the Simple Physical Activity Questionnaire (SIMPAQ) and Brief Symptoms Inventory -18. The median (interquartile) 2MWT score on the first and second test were 128.0 (44.0) meters and 128.0 (31.5) meters, without significant difference between the two trials. The intraclass coefficient was 0.94 (95% confidence interval=0.91-0.97). The significant Spearman Rho correlation between the second 2MWT and the 6MWT was 0.69. The MDC was 22 m for men and 21 m for women. There was no evidence for a practice effect. Variability in SIMPAQ sedentary, exercise, incidental physical activity and leg pain following the test explained 54.6% of the variance in 2MWT score.

Worldwide, early marriage disproportionately affects females, and is associated with high teenage pregnancies, alongside its negative effects. While early marriage is common in Uganda (49%), it is highest in Eastern (30%) and lowest in Central (19%); as such, not all girls face the same risk of early marriage even within a country. The factors that influence early marriages are important to know for policy implication purposes in Uganda. This study aims to investigate the socio-economic and enabling factors that influence early marriages across the regions of Uganda. Methods: Using a weighted sample of 13,768 ever married women from the 2016 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey. Frequency distributions were used to describe the background characteristics of the women. Pearson’s chi-square (χ 2 ) test was used to investigate the associations between early marriage and socio-economic and enabling factors and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the net-effect of socio-economic and enabling factors on early marriage. Results: Early marriage was highest among women in Eastern region (30%), followed by Northern (27%) and Western (25%) while Central had the lowest proportion at 19%. Across the regions, the key determinants of early marriage were education level, age at first birth and age at first sex (p<0.05). However, residence, wealth status and religion were only predictors of early marriage in Western region (p<0.05). Conclusions: The study underscores the need to strengthen strategies that promote girl child education, delayed initiation of sexual intercourse and child birth as measures for addressing early marriage across regions. In light of the variations in factors across regions, there is also a need to employ interventions that target women in particular regions.  Keywords: Early marriage, Region, Uganda",,Research Square,,,2019-10-03,2019,,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Preprint,"Otim, Jude","Otim, Jude ()",,"Otim, Jude ()",0,0,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6140/v1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126036911,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being

This study, therefore, analyses the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats (SWOT) of blended learning in the Public Universities of Uganda, in a case study of Muni University. Descriptive survey design was employed in the research. The target sample of the survey was 25 lecturers and 189 students selected using a stratified random sampling technique from the three faculties. A questionnaire was employed in this study and the data collected were analyzed using SPSS Version 25. The findings of the study identified accessibility, positive attitude, and knowledge and skills as the major motivators for blended learning. The strengths of blended learning found included serving many students in a short time, university readiness, connected both in and out of class, basic IT skills and top management commitment. The weaknesses included low bandwidth and unstable internet, lack of a plagiarism tool, insufficient numbers of computers and dependent on internet connectivity. Opportunities cited were competency-based systems that made it easier to manage individual progress in line with university expansion plans, an accessible way of learning regardless of location and available external support. The threats included unreliable power supply, unreliable internet connection, exchanges of username and passwords by students, internet shorthand used in student assignments. Based on these results, the study provides a baseline to help government and public universities that would like to implement or newly incorporate blended learning to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats associated with the blended learning approach. The survey urges that plagiarism plugins for Moodle and BigBlue Button should be added, steady power supply should be provided, internet accessibility should be improved, blended learning training and workshops need to be improved and finally, policies, rules and standards pertaining to blended learning should be enacted.",The authors wish to thank all the respondents who sacrificed their time to take part in the study.

This research evaluates polygamy in the traditional Acholi society with a view to illustrate why it was dominant and whether the people perceived it as oppressive to women or not. I conducted Key informants’ interviews with married people, elders and traditional leaders among the Acholi and reviewed a host of literature on the subject of polygamy and gender equity. Polygamy was common in the traditional Acholi society. The view that polygamy is barbaric, oppressive and unconstitutional is recent and alien to the Acholi people.

The latest revision of the primary education curriculum led to the introduction of the Thematic Curriculum in 2007. This curriculum requires the use of pupils' mother tongues as languages of instruction from Primary One to Three and then English from Primary Five to Seven. Primary Four is a transitional year. Several studies have indicated that the Thematic Curriculum has been a failure. Although various reasons have been advanced for the challenges of the Thematic Curriculum, the greatest setback seems to be ethnic pluralism. Using in-depth interviews with teachers, parents, education officials and pupils, I investigated how ethnic pluralism impeded the implementation of the Thematic Curriculum in Uganda. I found that most districts in Uganda are multi-ethnic and therefore multi-lingual making it difficult to choose the dominant mother tongue to use as a language of instruction. Even when the dominant language is identified, the pupils and teachers are in most cases from diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.

To enhance understanding of these issues, semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 42 HIV-positive fisherfolk and 15 health care providers from two HIV clinics located in two fishing communities in Uganda. Fisherfolk's mobility and poor transport systems were significant barriers to access to and use of HIV treatment and care. Mobility, which involved regular movement between communities, sometimes led to fisherfolk's inability to access HIV treatment and care. A poor transport system in fishing communities - characterised by irregular transport services and boats in a poor condition - was reported to force both fisherfolk and health care providers sometimes to cancel journeys to centres providing treatment and support. Community-level factors such as these, which relate to the organisation and provision of transport in local community settings, are significant influences on access to HIV treatment and care.

A Review,"Chicken litter application on land as an organic fertilizer is the cheapest and most environmentally safe method of disposing of the volume generated from the rapidly expanding poultry industry worldwide. However, little is known about the safety of chicken litter for land application and general release into the environment. Bridging this knowledge gap is crucial for maximizing the benefits of chicken litter as an organic fertilizer and mitigating negative impacts on human and environmental health. The key safety concerns of chicken litter are its contamination with pathogens, including bacteria, fungi, helminthes, parasitic protozoa, and viruses; antibiotics and antibiotic-resistant genes; growth hormones such as egg and meat boosters; heavy metals; and pesticides. Despite the paucity of literature about chicken litter safety for land application, the existing information was scattered and disjointed in various sources, thus making them not easily accessible and difficult to interpret. We consolidated scattered pieces of information about known contaminants found in chicken litter that are of potential risk to human, animal, and environmental health and how they are spread. This review tested the hypothesis that in its current form, chicken litter does not meet the minimum standards for application as organic fertilizer. The review entails a meta-analysis of technical reports, conference proceedings, peer-reviewed journal articles, and internet texts. Our findings indicate that direct land application of chicken litter could be harming animal, human, and environmental health. For example, counts of pathogenic strains of Eschericia coli (105-1010 CFU g-1) and Coliform bacteria (106-108 CFU g-1) exceeded the maximum permissible limits (MPLs) for land application. In Australia, 100% of broiler litter tested was contaminated with Actinobacillus and re-used broiler litter was more contaminated with Salmonella than non-re-used broiler litter. Similarly, in the US, all (100%) broiler litter was contaminated with Eschericia coli containing genes resistant to over seven antibiotics, particularly amoxicillin, ceftiofur, tetracycline, and sulfonamide. Chicken litter is also contaminated with a vast array of antibiotics and heavy metals. There are no standards set specifically for chicken litter for most of its known contaminants. Even where standards exist for related products such as compost, there is wide variation across countries and bodies mandated to set standards for safe disposal of organic wastes. More rigorous studies are needed to ascertain the level of contamination in chicken litter from both broilers and layers, especially in developing countries where there is hardly any data; set standards for all the contaminants; and standardize these standards across all agencies, for safe disposal of chicken litter on land.",,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteria; Chickens; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Fertilizers; Fungi; Genes, Bacterial; Humans; Manure; Metals, Heavy; Poultry; Viruses",2019-09-20,2019,16,19,3521,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kyakuwaire, Margaret; Olupot, Giregon; Amoding, Alice; Nkedi-Kizza, Peter; Basamba, Twaha Ateenyi","Kyakuwaire, Margaret (Department of Agriculture, Kyambogo University, P.O.

Media reports have indicated a high incidence for CSA. The study, firstly, explored boys' and girls' experiences of sexual abuse by adults in this post-conflict region and secondly, interventions directed at improving the current situation of children at risk of child abuse and the survivors were investigated as well. The study was guided by radical feminism and nested ecological framework theories. Semi-structured interviews were conducted involving 43 sexually abused children. Narrative responses were audio recorded and transcribed. Content qualitative analysis was used to understand sexual offenses from children's perspectives. Participants mentioned the following as the most perilous situations; laxity in parental roles, cultural norms, and practices, patriarchal attitudes, child sexual desires and attitudes, family breakdown and alcoholism. The study found many reported cases of CSA in the region. The results imply the exigent need of separate units specifically for reporting and handling child sexual offenses, need for personnel training on gender issues and filing system in child protection agencies and family programs for both fathers and mothers on child protection strategies for prevention and mitigation of CSA.","We are greatly indebted to the study funders Deutscher Akdemischer Austauschdienst –German Academic Exchange service (DAAD), Kyambogo University and Makerere University where the corresponding author has received support as a doctoral student.

Mental health service user involvement could be an important strategy for advocacy and improving service delivery, particularly as Uganda redoubles its efforts to integrate mental health into primary health care (PHC). However, little is known on the most effective way to involve service users in mental health system strengthening.MethodsThis was a qualitative key informant interview study. At national level, 4 interviews were conducted with national level health workers and 3 service user organization representatives. At the district level, 2 interviews were conducted with district level health workers and 5 service user organization representatives. Data were analyzed using content thematic analysis.FindingsOverall, there was low mental service user participation in health system strengthening at both national and district levels. Health system strengthening activities included policy development, implementation of programs and research. Informants mentioned several barriers to service user involvement in mental health system strengthening. These were grouped into three categories: institutional, community and individual level factors. Institutional level barriers included: limited funding to form, train and develop mental health service user groups, institutional stigma and patronage by founder members of user organizations. Community level barriers included: abject poverty and community stigma. Individual level barriers included: low levels of awareness and presence of self-stigma. Informants also recommended some strategies to enhance service user involvement.ConclusionThe Uganda Ministry of Health should develop a strategy to improve service user participation in mental health system strengthening. This requires an appreciation of the importance of service users in improving service delivery. To address the barriers to service user involvement identified in this study requires concerted efforts by the Uganda Ministry of Health and the district health services, specifically with regard to attitudes of health workers, dealing with stigma at all levels, raising awareness about the rights of service users to participate in health systems strengthening activities, building capacity and financial empowerment of service user organizations.",We thank all our informants in Kampala and Kamuli.,International Journal of Mental Health Systems,,,2019-09-06,2019,13,1,60,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mugisha, James; Hanlon, Charlotte; Knizek, Birthe Loa; Ssebunnya, Joshua; Vancampfort, Davy; Kinyanda, Eugene; Kigozi, Fred","Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda; Butabika National Referral and Teaching Mental Hospital, Kampala, Uganda; PO.

Routine screening following pharmacotherapy is however unacceptably low in sub-Saharan African countries with less than 1% adequately screened. It is unknown whether this is due to a lack of adequate competences.
Objectives: The aim of this pilot study was to assess the barriers, attitudes, confidence, and knowledge of nurses regarding metabolic health, prevention and treatment in Uganda.
Methods: Twenty-eight nurses (39% female, 30.9±6.9 years) completed the Metabolic - Barriers, Confidence, Attitudes and Knowledge Questionnaire and the physical activity prescription rate item of the Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire.
Results: More than 75% had a positive attitude towards metabolic screening and intervention and more than 50% were confident in providing smoking cessation advice, and physical activity and nutritional counseling. However, 57% stated that their heavy workload prevented them from doing health screening and promotion activities. There was a negative correlation (ρ=-0.54, P=0.003) between the frequency of physical activity prescription and the perception of the inability of patients to change.
Conclusion: The present findings suggest that nurses are generally supportive of metabolic health screening and intervention but their high workload prevents them from implementing metabolic health interventions.","Acknowledgements

This study assesses differences in HIV testing and receipt of results (HTR) between adolescent and non-adolescent women in Uganda. The differences were decomposed into components attributed to variation in characteristics and variation in effects of characteristics in the two groups. The assessment was based on data sourced from 2011 Uganda Demographic Health Survey. Statistical analysis was done using a Non-linear Oaxaca’ Blinder Multivariate Decomposition of the logistic regression.

A consensus set of mental health indicators has been proposed but evidence on their use in routine settings is lacking.
AIMS: To assess the acceptability, feasibility, perceived costs and sustainability of implementing indicators relating to integrated mental health service coverage in six South Asian (India, Nepal) and sub-Saharan African countries (Ethiopia, Nigeria, South Africa, Uganda).
METHOD: A qualitative study using semi-structured key informant interviews (n = 128) was conducted. The 'Performance of Routine Information Systems' framework served as the basis for a coding framework covering three main categories related to the performance of new tools introduced to collect data on mental health indicators: (1) technical; (2) organisation; and (3) behavioural determinants.
RESULTS: Most mental health indicators were deemed relevant and potentially useful for improving care, and therefore acceptable to end users. Exceptions were indicators on functionality, cost and severity. The simplicity of the data-capturing formats contributed to the feasibility of using forms to generate data on mental health indicators. Health workers reported increasing confidence in their capacity to record the mental health data and minimal additional cost to initiate mental health reporting. However, overstretched primary care staff and the time-consuming reporting process affected perceived sustainability.
CONCLUSIONS: Use of the newly developed, contextually appropriate mental health indicators in health facilities providing primary care services was seen largely to be feasible in the six Emerald countries, mainly because of the simplicity of the forms and continued support in the design and implementation stage. However, approaches to implementation of new forms generating data on mental health indicators need to be customised to the specific health system context of different countries. Further work is needed to identify ways to utilise mental health data to monitor and improve the quality of mental health services.

AIMS: To investigate systems-level implications of efforts to scale-up integrated mental healthcare into PHC in districts in six LMICs.
METHOD: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 121 managers and service providers. Transcribed interviews were analysed using framework analysis guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and World Health Organization basic building blocks.
RESULTS: Ensuring that interventions are synergistic with existing health system features and strengthening of the healthcare system building blocks to support integrated chronic care and task-sharing were identified as aiding integration efforts. The latter includes (a) strengthening governance to include technical support for integration efforts as well as multisectoral collaborations; (b) ring-fencing mental health budgets at district level; (c) a critical mass of mental health specialists to support task-sharing; (d) including key mental health indicators in the health information system; (e) psychotropic medication included on free essential drug lists and (f) enabling collaborative and community- oriented PHC-service delivery platforms and continuous quality improvement to aid service delivery challenges in implementation.
CONCLUSIONS: Scaling up integrated mental healthcare in PHC in LMICs is more complex than training general healthcare providers. Leveraging existing health system processes that are synergistic with chronic care services and strengthening healthcare system building blocks to provide a more enabling context for integration are important.

This study aims to evaluate a new set of mental health indicators introduced in primary healthcare settings in five LMIC.
METHOD: A survey was conducted among primary healthcare workers (n = 272) to assess the acceptability and feasibility of eight new indicators monitoring mental healthcare needs, utilisation, quality and payments. Also, primary health facility case records (n = 583) were reviewed by trained research assistants to assess the level of completion (yes/no) for each of the indicators and subsequently the level of correctness of completion (correct/incorrect - with incorrect defined as illogical, missing or illegible information) of the indicators used by health workers. Assessments were conducted within 1 month of the introduction of the indicators, as well as 6-9 months afterwards.
RESULTS: Across both time points and across all indicators, 78% of the measurements of indicators were complete. Among the best performing indicators (diagnosis, severity and treatment), this was significantly higher. With regards to correctness, 87% of all completed indicators were correctly completed. There was a trend towards improvement over time. Health workers' perceptions on feasibility and utility, across sites and over time, indicated a positive attitude in 81% of all measurements.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates high levels of performance and perceived utility for a set of indicators that could ultimately be used to monitor coverage of mental healthcare in primary healthcare settings in LMIC. We recommend that these indicators are incorporated into existing health information systems and adopted within the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Programme implementation strategy.

While a growing body of research has identified various factors to explain this underperformance, it has not paid much attention to the analysis of whether instructional leadership is among the causes and if it can provide a solution to this challenge. Therefore, this study provides this analysis. The study employed a cross-sectional correlational survey involving collection of questionnaire data from 341 lecturers and 35 heads of departments (instructional leaders) selected from Makerere University and Kyambogo University using stratified sampling. The data was analysed using descriptive, data transformation, and linear regression analysis. Findings established instructional leadership as a positive and significant predictor of lecturers’ job performance. These findings suggest that improving instructional leadership by availing lecturers with adequate instructional resources and supervising and monitoring them effectively can improve their job performance. Accordingly, the study recommends to the management of Uganda’s public universities to stock sufficient teaching resources and to ensure that their heads of departments play their supervisory and monitoring roles effectively .",,Makerere Journal of Higher Education,,,2019-08-06,2019,10,2,93-118,All OA; Gold,Article,"Namutebi, Edith","Namutebi, Edith (Kampala University)",,"Namutebi, Edith (Kampala University)",0,0,,,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/majohe/article/download/188668/177921,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120179598,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,

Quantitative data was collected through stakeholder‐specific structured questionnaires, whilst qualitative data was collected through desk review and field visits, individual focused interviews and focus group discussions. Our findings indicate that financing and planning constraints have resulted in poor quality equipment, under‐ and ill‐trained staff, limited adoption of a competence‐based education and training (CBET) curriculum, not to mention the supervision inadequacies of TVET institutions. Besides, the limited TVET sub‐sector interaction with the private sector has incapacitated TVET curriculum development to nurture skills demanded by the private sector. Furthermore, backward technology use in the private sector has equally inhibited the success of student attachment programmes. Finally, legal ambiguities have perpetuated a qualification jungle and overlapping curricula.",This is the first output of the International Development Research Centre (IDRC) Regional Project No: 108174‐001.

We have played a major role in the development of practice guidelines and policies, as well as in the application of ethical principles in cultural contexts. The Counseling Psychologist has served to disseminate information addressing needs and interventions for diverse communities. In this article, we review the history and impact of our efforts to ameliorate oppression. The pressing challenges of economic and educational disparities are highlighted along with how counseling psychologists are uniquely situated to meet the needs of the underserved. Our research, training, and practice are anchored in methodological pluralism, global helping paradigms, participatory engagement, and the promotion of liberation and radical healing.

However, there is limited information on the influence of maize planting density in the cassava/maize intercrop on the performance of hybrid maize and improved cassava genotypes in Uganda. Thus, this study determined whether recently released cassava genotypes which are selected on the basis of monocrop performance, would perform equally well when intercropped with hybrid maize varieties. Cassava genotypes NAROCASS 1 and NASE 14 intercropped with Longe 6H maize were evaluated using randomized complete block design and three replications. Treatments were: Sole maize (SM), sole cassava (SC), alternate rows of cassava and maize (1C:1M), and one row of cassava alternating with two rows of maize (1C:2M). Intercropping significantly increased the maize plant heights in the 1C:2M system than in sole maize. Cob length and number of rows per cob decreased as the plant population density increased. Maize grain yield under the 1C:1M system was comparable to that of sole cropping. The 1C:2M system gave significantly reduced grain yields when compared with those at 1C:1M. Cassava root yield decreased in the order (SM>1C:1M>1C:2M). Although the yields of both cassava and maize under sole cropping were higher than their intercrop counterparts, intercropping was more productive than sole cropping as evidenced by the land equivalent ratios.",,International Journal of Research -GRANTHAALAYAH,,,2019-07-31,2019,7,7,6-21,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ekwaro, Benson; Wanaku, Boniface; Katuromunda, Sylvester","Ekwaro, Benson (); Wanaku, Boniface (); Katuromunda, Sylvester ()",,"Ekwaro, Benson (); Wanaku, Boniface (); Katuromunda, Sylvester ()",0,0,,,https://www.granthaalayahpublication.org/journals/index.php/granthaalayah/article/download/IJRG19_A07_2424/553,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129587495,0607 Plant Biology; 0703 Crop and Pasture Production; 06 Biological Sciences; 07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences,

An estimated 350 people died and some of the affected were resettled in Kiryandongo district. We assessed housing, water and sanitation practises of affected households and controls to establish possible implications on food insecurity and diet diversity.
METHODS: This cross-sectional study assessed 1078 affected and control households in Bududa and Kiryandongo districts. The head of the households were either affected, selected from landslide disaster-affected communities, or controls from a random sub-county bordering the affected. Structured interviews were used and entries were tested statistically to report crude estimates based on the Pearson x2 and ANOVA, while adjusted analysis used multivariate analysis of co-variance (MANCOVA) and Wald's Odds Ratio (OR) of Binary Logistic Regression at the 95% CI.
RESULTS: On adjusting for the disaster and covariates, households who had insufficient access to water scored higher mean (SE) on food insecurity than those who reported sufficient access: 13.1 (0.4) vs. 9.5 (0.3) (P",We thank the households for their availability and willingness to participate in this study.

The data were analyzed using the SPSS Version 20.0 software, which involved descriptive statistical method, mean, and standard deviation. Data collection for the assessment phase involves construction technology lecturers from 45 vocational colleges in all the states in Peninsular Malaysia. The respondents of the study were 304 lecturers who taught CTCE courses in vocational colleges from 14 states, namely Johor, Sarawak, and Federal Territory (Kuala Lumpur and Labuan). Finding shows that the professional general competency level of TVET CTCE vocational college lecturers based on years of teaching experience is high with satisfactory interpretation. It also shows that the level of professional competency of TVET CTCE lecturer of vocational college based on grade of the post is high, whereas the level of entrepreneurship skill competency as a whole is at moderate level. There was a slight decrease in the proficiency level profile of the CTCE lecturer who had more than 15 years of experience compared with those with teaching experience of 15 years or less. There found positive relationships between the dimensions of professionalism and the generic skills. The findings of the study will help the Ministry of Education in particular public or private institutions of higher learning in preparing TVET lecturers to become specialized, highly skilled, competent, and efficient in civil engineering courses in the attempt to strengthen the teaching profession, especially in technical and vocational education, which is in line with the aspirations of the 21

Conversely, HIV is the most important risk factor in the progression of TB from the latent to the active status. In order to manage this double epidemic situation, an integrated approach that includes HIV management in TB patients was proposed by the World Health Organization and was implemented in Uganda (one of the countries endemic with both diseases). To enable targeted intervention using the integrated approach, areas with high disease prevalence rates for TB and HIV need to be identified first. However, there is no such study in Uganda, addressing the joint spatial patterns of these two diseases.MethodsThis study uses global Moran’s index, spatial scan statistics and bivariate global and local Moran’s indices to investigate the geographical clustering patterns of both diseases, as individuals and as combined. The data used are TB and HIV case data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 obtained from the District Health Information Software 2 system, housed and maintained by the Ministry of Health, Uganda.ResultsResults from this analysis show that while TB and HIV diseases are highly correlated (55–76%), they exhibit relatively different spatial clustering patterns across Uganda. The joint TB/HIV prevalence shows consistent hotspot clusters around districts surrounding Lake Victoria as well as northern Uganda. These two clusters could be linked to the presence of high HIV prevalence among the fishing communities of Lake Victoria and the presence of refugees and internally displaced people camps, respectively. The consistent cold spot observed in eastern Uganda and around Kasese could be explained by low HIV prevalence in communities with circumcision tradition.ConclusionsThis study makes a significant contribution to TB/HIV public health bodies around Uganda by identifying areas with high joint disease burden, in the light of TB/HIV co-infection. It, thus, provides a valuable starting point for an informed and targeted intervention, as a positive step towards a TB and HIV-AIDS free community.","The authors acknowledge the staff at the Ministry of Health, Uganda especially Mr. Stephen Akena Abwoye for providing the data used in this study.

Nurses and occupational therapists working in low-resourced mental health settings are well-placed to provide exercise advice for people with mental illness.
Objectives: We examined the current exercise prescription practices employed by Ugandan health care professionals when working with people with mental illness, and identified perceived barriers to exercise prescription and exercise participation for people with mental illness.
Methods: In this study, 31 Ugandan health care professionals 20 men; 31.2 ± 7.1 years completed the Exercise in Mental Illness Questionnaire- Health Professionals Version EMIQ-HP.
Results: The vast majority of the respondents 29/31, 94% reported they prescribed exercise at least ""occasionally"" to people with mental illness. Exercise-prescription parameters used were consistent with those recommended for people with mental illness. Regarding barriers to exercise participation, coping with side effects of psychotropic medication at the individual level and reducing stigma at community level should be prioritized.

Applied to analyse trends in annual and seasonal runoff over this period, the sequential MK test showed a sudden change point in stream flow in 1994. The study period was, therefore, divided into two sub-periods: 1975–1994 and 1995–2010. The SWAT model showed obvious changes in water resource components between the two periods: in comparison to the period of 1975–1994, sub-watershed-scale stream flow and soil moisture decreased during 1995–2010. Changes in evapotranspiration were negligible compared to those in stream flow and soil moisture. The hydrological sensitivity method indicated that climatic variability and human activities contributed to 29.86% and 70.14%, respectively, of changes in annual stream flow, while the SWAT model placed these contributions at 34.78% and 65.21%, respectively. The double mass curve method indicated the contribution of climatic variability to stream flow changes to be 57.5% for the wet season and 22.87% for the dry season, while human activities contributed 42.5% and 77.13%, respectively. Accordingly, in the face of climatic variability, measures should be developed and implemented to mitigate its impacts and maintain eco-environmental integrity and water supplies.","The authors are grateful to the Islamic Republic of Iran Meteorological Organization (IRIMO) and the Water Resources Management Company of the Ministry of Energy, Islamic Republic of Iran for the provision of meteorological and hydrological data.",Journal of Hydro-environment Research,,,2019-06,2019,25,,12-24,Closed,Article,"Pirnia, Abdollah; Darabi, Hamid; Choubin, Bahram; Omidvar, Ebrahim; Onyutha, Charles; Haghighi, Ali Torabi","Pirnia, Abdollah (Department of Watershed Management Engineering, Sari Agriculture Science and Natural Resources University, P.O.

However, farmers' coping strategies and their determinants remain under–documented. In this study, we: 1) characterise relationships between perceptions of drought and food insecurity and corresponding household coping responses, 2) compare livelihood characteristics of farmers that perceived food insecurity as a problem and those who did not, and 3) investigate how household-level characteristics correspond to household coping strategies. Our study is exploratory in nature: we administered a questionnaire to 140 farmers in Isingiro district in South-west (SW) Uganda whose livelihood is predominantly dependent on crop production. We employ binomial and multinomial logistic regression models to identify the determinants of the respondents’ perceptions, how household characteristics correspond to household perceptions of food insecurity, and factors that affect coping responses. Our data show that 68.6% of the respondents perceived food insecurity as a problem in their household.

8,pub.1115971619,10.7577/sjvd.3249,,,Analysing the Interplay Between Institutional-Based and Workplace Learning,"Learning and working are two significant social networks in preparing individuals for future life. An understanding of learning in the workplace can inform how we organize institutional learning in order to produce competent and relevant vocational education and training (VET) graduates for the world of work. This paper explores the existing collaborative activities in the masters in vocational pedagogy (MVP) study program at Kyambogo University in Uganda and their linkage with workplaces. Two research questions were posed. (1) What collaborative activities are there in the MVP program that allow for learning in vocational teacher training institutions (VTIs) and workplaces? 2) How is knowledge constructed amongst the participating actors? The questions were investigated through in-depth, semi-structured interviews with purposively sampled participants.

2,pub.1115885427,10.1155/2019/2401818,,,Dynamically Dimensioned Search Embedded with Piecewise Opposition-Based Learning for Global Optimization,"Dynamically dimensioned search (DDS) is a well-known optimization algorithm in the field of single solution-based heuristic global search algorithms. Its successful application in the calibration of watershed environmental parameters has attracted researcher’s extensive attention. The dynamically dimensioned search algorithm is a kind of algorithm that converges to the global optimum under the best condition or the good local optimum in the worst case. In other words, the performance of DDS is easily affected by the optimization conditions. Therefore, this algorithm has also suffered from low robustness and limited scalability. In this work, an improved version of DDS called DDS-POBL is proposed. In the DDS-POBL, two effective methods are applied to improve the performance of the DDS algorithm. Piecewise opposition-based learning is introduced to guide DDS search in the right direction, and the golden section method is used to search for more promising areas. Numerical experiments are performed on a set of 23 classic test functions, and the results represent significant improvements in the optimization performance of DDS-POBL compared to DDS. Several experimental results using different parameter values demonstrate the high solution quality, strong robustness, and scalability of the proposed DDS-POBL algorithm. A comparative performance analysis between the DDS-POBL and other powerful algorithms has been carried out by statistical methods by using the significance of the results. The results show that DDS-POBL works better than PSO, CoDA, MHDA, NaFA, and CMA-ES and gives very competitive results when compared to INMDA and EEGWO. Moreover, the parameter calibration application of the Xinanjiang model shows the effectiveness of the DDS-POBL in the real optimization problem.","This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant no. 71841054), Soft Science Foundation of Heilongjiang Province (Grant no.

The WHO guidelines, Ugandan standards, Canadian guidelines and Swedish EPA were used for assessment. The shallow groundwater was acidic with pH values below 6.5. The pH, dissolved organic carbon, flouride, and sulphate levels for all springs were below the guideline values although 52.8% was contaminated with nitrates while 39% was contaminated with chloride ions. Some surface water samples had levels of major elements, such as iron, chromium, aluminium, and manganese, above the guideline values. Speciation studies showed that 74% of the metal ions was bound to dissolved organic matter in surface water, whereas in landfill leachates, the dominant ionic species was metal hydroxides or fulvic acid bound. Risk analysis based on the Swedish EPA showed varied risks of negative effects in 30%-76% of the sample sites ranging from high to increased risk in surface water, whereas the results from modelling sorption data using the Bio-met tool showed potential risk to toxicity effects of Cu2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, and Pb2+ in 15.3%-30.8% surface water samples and 8.3%-62.5% groundwater samples.","This study was funded by the Royal Swedish Government through the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida) support to Uganda–Makerere University Bilateral Research Program.

A longitudinal transect design was used in this study. Transects of 100 m wide were drawn on 6 selected ridges, within which 102 peasant farms with different conservation technologies were selected. The severity of erosion on the selected farms, assessed from the areal extent of physical erosion indicators, was used to determine the efficiency of the soil conservation technologies in controlling erosion. The results indicate that terracing, found on 57.8% of the selected peasant farms, was the most dominant soil conservation practice on the Rwenzori Mountain slopes, followed by trash bunds, water diversion channels, water collection ditches, and mulching. It was, however, evident that despite the adoption of soil conservation practices by some farmers, soil erosion remained high, especially on farms where one conservation practice was solerly used. It is therefore recommended that a more comprehensive soil conservation strategy, involving the use of agronomic soil management and mechanical methods of soil conservation, be emphasized in the Rwenzori highlands.",,Climate Change Management,Agriculture and Ecosystem Resilience in Sub Saharan Africa,,2019-05-23,2019,,,145-166,Closed,Chapter,"Muhamud, Nabalegwa Wambede; Joyfred, Asaba","Muhamud, Nabalegwa Wambede (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Joyfred, Asaba (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Muhamud, Nabalegwa Wambede (Kyambogo University)","Muhamud, Nabalegwa Wambede (Kyambogo University); Joyfred, Asaba (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115214147,0503 Soil Sciences; 05 Environmental Sciences; 0502 Environmental Science and Management,15 Life on Land

Since the 1980s, many resources have been devoted to agricultural sector by the government and donor community with the aim of transforming it from predominantly subsistence to one where farmers produce for the market. This was expected to take place with increased farmers’ adoption of modern farming technologies. Scientists developed a number of technologies with a hope that once they are introduced to the farmers,they would be readily adopted. This has not been the case. The uptake of the modern technologies has not been impressive. Even where adoption has taken place, it is on a piecemeal basis. Therefore there is a need to examine the factors that have led to the low rate of technology uptake and hence limited agricultural transformation in the country. The data collection methods used in this study included questionnaires, interviews, direct observation and document review. The study covered the social and economic conditions of the farming communities that are hypothesised to be limiting the uptake of technologies that would lead to agricultural modernisation. The study analysed the relationship between the socio-economic factors and adoption to modern farming technologies. The chi-square test was used to establish whether there were significant differences in education level, membership to farmer organisations/farmer groups, family size, etc. between adopters and non-adopters of modern farming technologies and hence agricultural transformation. Multiple regression was used to establish the most important factors influencing agricultural transformation in the area. The findings indicated that the most important factors influencing farmers’ adoption of modern farming technologies and hence agricultural transformation are membership to agricultural organisation and cost of inputs. It can be concluded that the government and other organisations promoting agricultural modernisation should encourage farmers to form groups where they learn modern methods. It should also provide subsidies to farm input so that they are affordable to the farmers.",,Climate Change Management,Agriculture and Ecosystem Resilience in Sub Saharan Africa,,2019-05-23,2019,,,29-52,Closed,Chapter,"Wambede, Nabalegwa Muhamud; Joyfred, Asaba; Jimmy, Alule Rhombe","Wambede, Nabalegwa Muhamud (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Joyfred, Asaba (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Jimmy, Alule Rhombe (Gulu University, Gulu, Uganda)","Wambede, Nabalegwa Muhamud (Kyambogo University)","Wambede, Nabalegwa Muhamud (Kyambogo University); Joyfred, Asaba (Kyambogo University); Jimmy, Alule Rhombe (Gulu University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1115214128,1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of pruning and waxing on fresh root storability among cassava varieties in Uganda. Sixteen cassava plants per variety (TME 14, NASE 14, Nyaraboke, Kirimumpale, and Bukalasa) were pruned seven days before harvest, leaving the rest as unpruned controls. After harvest, roots were divided into two portions and one portion was waxed using food grade wax. Pruning alone reduced PPD of stored roots by 23% at day 14 of storage; and by 19% at day 28 compared with the control. Pruning as a treatment resulted into increased sugar content, ranging 9-30%), and significant (P<0.05) losses in starch yield. Pruning combined with waxing, resulted in a reduction of up to 43% in PPD by day 14, and up to 67 at day 28. Reduction in carbohydrate (starch) was not significant (P>0.05) under the pruning and waxing treatment, which had minor effects on stored root composition. The results indicate that pruning is appropriate for the short-term storage of fresh cassava roots for up to 14 days. Waxing, combined with pruning, is suitable for longer term storage up to 28 days under Uganda conditions.

There has been limited research with respect to communities along Lake Albert on the border between Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
Methods: We conducted a qualitative study on three landing sites of Butiaba, Bugoigo, and Wanseko on the shores of Lake Albert along the border of Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Data were collected using 12 Focus Group Discussions and 15 key informant interviews. Analysis was done manually using content and thematic approaches.
Results: Lakeshore livelihoods split families between men, women, and children with varying degrees of exposure to HIV infection risk. Sustaining a thriving fish trade was dependent on taking high risks. For instance, profits were high when the lake was stormy. Landing sites were characterized by widespread prostitution, alcohol consumption, drug abuse, and child labour. Such behaviors negatively affected minors and in many ways predisposed them to HIV infection. The lake shore-border heterogeneity resulted in a population with varying HIV knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and competencies to risk perception and adaptation amidst negative masculinities and negative resilience.
Conclusion: The susceptibility of lakeshore communities to HIV is attributable to a complex combination of geo-socio, the available (health) services, economic, and cultural factors which converged around the fishing livelihood. This study reveals that HIV risk assessment is an interplay of plural rationalities within the circumstances and constraints that impinge on the daily lives by different actors. A lack of cohesion in a multiethnic setting with large numbers of outsiders and a large transient population made the available HIV interventions less effective.","We are indebted to our respondents, district officials, local guides, and interpreters.

In this follow-up study of an open cluster-randomized intervention trial we examined the effects of an education package delivered to mothers in rural Uganda on their children's development, growth and gut microbiota at 36 months of age.
Methods: The parental trial included 511 mother-child pairs recruited when the children were 6-8 months. In that trial, a nutrition, stimulation and hygiene education was delivered to mothers in the intervention group while the control group received routine health care. A follow-up sample of 155 pairs (intervention n = 77, control n = 78) were re-enrolled when the children were 24 months. Developmental outcomes were assessed with the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (BSID-III) composite scores for cognitive (primary endpoint), language and motor development. Development outcomes were also evaluated using the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ) and the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL). Other outcomes included growth and gut microbiota composition.
Results: The demographic characteristics were not different (P > 0.05) between the intervention and control groups and similar to those of the parental study. The intervention group had higher BSID-III scores than controls, with mean difference 10.13 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.31-17.05, P = 0.002); 7.59 (1.62-13.66, P = 0.01); 9.00 (2.92-15.40, P = 0.005), for cognitive, language and motor composite scores, respectively. An improvement in the intervention compared to the control group was obtained for both the ASQ and the MSEL scores. The mean difference in height-for-age z-score was higher in the intervention compared to the control group: 0.50 (0.25-0.75, P = 0.0001). Gut microbiota composition did not differ significantly between the two study groups.
Conclusions: The maternal education intervention had positive effects on child development and growth at three years, but did not alter gut microbiota composition. This intervention may be applicable in other low-resource settings.

Evidence and lessons from the production and supply of bananas in Uganda,"Despite agriculture being the main economic activity in Uganda, increasing food prices within the country point to the growing challenge of food insecurity. In 2016, food shortage was reported in some parts of Uganda (mainly in Karamoja sub-region and parts of Serere) and government resorted to temporary relief distribution of food from other regions of the country. The acute food shortage in one part of the country while another part, a few hundred kilometers away, has excess farm output calls into question the efficiency of the supply chain of some agro-commodities. This research attempts to examine the challenges faced in the production and supply of bananas in Uganda and how the supply chain perspective can help us address these challenges better. We juxtapose the supply chain approach against the value chain perspective and argue that the supply chain perspective offers a much deeper understanding of market-based challenges, which affect livelihoods of smallholders who often sell their products at rock-bottom prices. A cross sectional survey of various banana production and consumptions points in Uganda was conducted. The findings show that losses in the supply chain accounted for about 29% of banana production – a figure slightly lower than that 40% previously reported in the literature. In addition, the farmers did not benefit from increased food prices due to inadequate market information at their disposal despite banana value chains having recently received significant development attention. We also found that infrastructural bottlenecks and limited collaboration and coordination among smallholders heavily affected the supply of bananas in the country. This is arguably a key factor that strongly explains the food insecurity problem in Uganda. We conclude that the findings point to a different problem, which is that of a dysfunctional supply chain structure of bananas from the rural areas to urban centres in Kampala.","The authors thank the respondents who participated in the survey in Mbale, Bushenyi and in Kampala.

2,pub.1113518061,10.5897/err2018.3598,,,Pastoral education: The missing link in Uganda education system,"Pastoralism is a production system closely linked with cultural identity that relies on raising livestock on pastures. Studies indicate that over 30 million people in the Great Horn of Africa (Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, South Sudan, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan, Tanzania and Uganda) practice pastoralism and agro-pastoralism as a major source of livelihoods. Livestock are their social, cultural, spiritual and economic assets providing food and income for the family within and between generations. Yet this important production system of livelihood as well as socialisation mechanism is missing in the school or university curriculum of these countries including Uganda. With the exception of Tanzania and Ethiopia that have recently designed a curriculum on pastoral studies in their university curriculum, pastoral education has been missing in the school and University curriculum of the Great Horn of Africa school systems yet most of these countries livelihoods depend on pastoralism. From the socialisation perspective, the dynamism surrounding the livelihoods of these communities and/ or families impedes peace in society. Families as social units play very important role of socialisation and recreation therefore, making pastoral education an important element not only from an African traditional context but also from the sociological perspectives. The sense and complex nature of communities and households struggling to improve on their own survival and development through the practice of pastoralism are complex yet central to the maintenance of peace and stability of the communities. The inclusion of pastoral education to the school and university curriculum as a common or cross cutting course unit would introduce undergraduate and postgraduate students to the fascinating and rich world of pastoralism. This would provide the students with knowledge and skills to analyse and understand pastoral systems as they exist today, and the options for their future development in support of national economic growth in a changing world. The curriculum would also help students from different backgrounds to understand how pastoralism functions as a system, its contributions to local, national and global economies and sustainable environmental management, and its role in promoting peace, socialisation, and harmony between pastoral and other communities.

Yet, there is dearth of prevalence data on child and adolescent behavioral challenges within sub-Saharan Africa, including Uganda. This study aims to estimate the prevalence rate of behavioral challenges and ADHD among young school going children and early adolescents (ages 8–13 at study enrollment), utilizing a school-based sample in southwest Uganda.MethodsWe present screening results from a 5-year scale-up study titled SMART Africa-Uganda (2016–2021), set across 30 public primary schools located in the greater Masaka region in Uganda, a region heavily impacted by poverty and HIV/AIDS. Specifically, we draw on screening data from caregivers of 2434 children that used well-established standardized measures that had been pre-tested in the region. These were: 1) oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) and conduct disorder (CD) subscales of the Disruptive Behavior Disorders (DBD) scale; and 2) the Iowa Connors and Impairment scales. Slightly over half of the children in the sample were female (52%), with a mean age of 10.27 years.ResultsOf the 2434 participants screened for disruptive behaviors: 1) 6% (n = 136) scored positive on ODD and 2% (n = 42) scored positive on CD subscales of the DBD scale; 2) 9.61% (n = 234), and 2.67% (n = 65) were reported to have elevated symptoms of ODD and ADHD on the Iowa Connors caregiver report scale respectively. Twenty-five percent (n = 586) of children were described by their caregivers as having experienced some form of impairment in at least four domains of the Impairment scale.ConclusionThe results indicate the presence of behavioral challenges and ADHD among school going children, aged 8–13 years, in Uganda. Given the negative outcomes associated with behavioral challenges as children transition to adolescence and adulthood, detecting these emerging behavioral challenges early is critical in developing appropriate interventions. School settings could be considered as one of the contextually-relevant, culturally-appropriate, and non-stigmatizing venues to implement screening procedures and to detect emerging behavioral challenges and to make necessary referrals.","Acknowledgements

Particular focus is on the Uganda Women Parliamentary Association (UWOPA) as one of the essential components of the women’s movement in Uganda. Based on a qualitative phenomenological research design and a sample size of 10 female and 4 male long-serving parliamentarians, this article examines how women parliamentarians were able to enhance women's voices during deliberations in the Ugandan Parliament, and how collaborations with women's organisations and male legislators in Uganda enhanced women's voices during these deliberations. The findings revealed that: (a) participants attributed their successes with gender-sensitive laws and policies to the power of caucusing, sisterhood and women's collective voice, and (b) women participants revealed that the success of legislation such as The Domestic Violence Act, and Prohibition of Female Genital Mutilation resulted from collaboration with male legislators, some of whom were also members of UWOPA.

Strain-softening is performed on the elements by a developed anisotropic continuum damage model that has more effective capability in crack path prediction and is easily available in standard finite elements. In the present damage model, the damaged stiffness tensor is constructed to form a crack surface, and the energy dissipation in the damaged element is only allowed in the direction perpendicular to the crack plane. Crack surface is divided into crack lines and crack triangles based on the first introduced crack surface discretization, and the application scope of local tracking algorithm is extended from two dimension to 3D. The present tracking algorithm not only guarantees the continuity and stability of the predicted crack path by solving the topological problems but also has low computational cost, keeping the advantages of local tracking. The method does not identify the crack plane within each element, but it couples well with smeared crack method by identifying all the elements through which the crack surface passes. The high efficiency and stability of the present approach are verified by resolving several 3D benchmark problems in failure analysis.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [Grant Nos. 11472086, 11532013].",Computers & Structures,,,2019-04,2019,215,,65-79,Closed,Article,"Yun, Kumchol; Wang, Zhenqing; Chang, Mengzhou; Liu, Jingbiao; Kim, Tae-Jong; Son, Namjin; Ji, Kyongsu; Ronald, Sakaya","Yun, Kumchol (Faculty of Mechanics, Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea); Wang, Zhenqing (College of Aerospace and Civil Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, PR China); Chang, Mengzhou (College of Aerospace and Civil Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, PR China); Liu, Jingbiao (College of Aerospace and Civil Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin, PR China); Kim, Tae-Jong (Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Kimchaek University of Technology, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea); Son, Namjin (Faculty of Mechanics, Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea); Ji, Kyongsu (Department of Information Engineering, Chongjin Mine Metal University, Chongjin, Democratic People’s Republic of Korea); Ronald, Sakaya (College of Civil and Building Engineering, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Yun, Kumchol (Kim Il-sung University)","Yun, Kumchol (Kim Il-sung University); Wang, Zhenqing (Harbin Engineering University); Chang, Mengzhou (Harbin Engineering University); Liu, Jingbiao (Harbin Engineering University); Kim, Tae-Jong (); Son, Namjin (Kim Il-sung University); Ji, Kyongsu (); Ronald, Sakaya (Kyambogo University)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112196700,0912 Materials Engineering; 09 Engineering,

The smallest open reading frame encodes the structural proteins. The largest open reading frame encodes a large putative protein, p130. The second overlapping open reading frame encodes two non-structural proteins; p40, a proposed accessory protein and p104, the replicase, containing the RdRp domain. Till date, p130 and p40 are not associated with any related open reading frames in the databases. The purpose of this study is to identify sequences within these non-structural proteins with potential roles in replication and evolution using computational tools. Our results revealed that p130 has a putative arginine-rich sequence which lies in the disordered region also found in the Umbravirus, Groundnut rosette virus p27. Analysis of the p40 revealed a sequence with a coiled-coil conformation and surface-exposed characteristics comparable to the interaction domain of Tombusvirus, Tomato bushy stunt virus p33 accessory protein. The hypothetical two transmembrane helix topology of PrV p104 oriented the putative localization signal at the N-terminus, the same way the localization signal of Tomato bushy stunt virus p92 is oriented. This study concluded that Providence virus non-structural proteins are structurally related to Tombusvirus and Umbravirus accessory proteins and contain sequences with predicted functions in replication. Findings from this study have led us to propose a co-evolutionary event between an insect and plant virus resulting in a hybrid virus with the potential to infect and replicate in both host plant and animal systems.

Disability studies scholars have argued for valuing diverse understandings and a different discourse when studying disability and inclusion in low-income countries. In this paper, we explore the meaning of belonging and inclusion to parents of children with disabilities in central Uganda. Through case study analysis we aim to give alternative starting points for inclusive primary education programmes. We explore the themes ‘missing parts’, the ‘ability to manage’, ‘belonging to a family’, and ‘being given a chance’ as key concepts of disability and inclusion. We argue not to translate parents’ descriptions into international categories and framework, but to reflect on the larger and underlying meaning of the concepts to form a more culturally embedded and relevant starting point of education for all. We propose to address the gaps of the postcolonial education system that has taken teachers’ and families’ away from the concept of ‘obuntu bulamu’, and focus interventions on re-creating this togetherness and value the strength of concepts of belonging and caring for each other.",No potential conflict of interest was reported by the authors.,International Journal of Disability Development and Education,,,2019-03-25,2019,67,4,1-19,Closed,Article,"Bannink, Femke; Nalugya, Ruth; van Hove, Geert","Bannink, Femke (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium; Medical Research Council / Uganda Research Virus Institute & London, School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Uganda Research Unit, Entebbe, Uganda, Correspondencefemke.bannink@ugent.be, http://orcid.org/0000-0001-6436-3431, View further author information); Nalugya, Ruth (Medical Research Council / Uganda Research Virus Institute & London, School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Uganda Research Unit, Entebbe, Uganda, View further author information); van Hove, Geert (Faculty of Psychology and Educational Sciences, Ghent University, Ghent, Belgium, http://orcid.org/0000-0003-3266-0524, View further author information)",,"Bannink, Femke (); Nalugya, Ruth (Uganda Virus Research Institute); van Hove, Geert (Ghent University)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1113007030,1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education,4 Quality Education; 10 Reduced Inequalities

Irrespective of the maturity or infancy of e-learning adoption in a university, the academic staff always have varying levels of commitment to online courseware development and delivery. Some will be actively engaged, some will be passively involved while others will remain ignorant about online courses’ issues. This paper investigates trends in online courseware development in Uganda and classifies emerging participation levels into three, namely active, passive and exclusive engagement. The latter clustering followed a survey of 120 academic staff from six public universities in Uganda, with general findings indicating low participation of instructors in courseware development. For instance, whereas 60% of the respondents had been trained in the use of authoring tools, only about a half of them had continued to use these tools for courseware development. Essentially, the survey revealed that the variation in courseware development engagement is caused by both the individual and institutional strengths (active case) and weaknesses (passive and exclusive scenarios). As such, institutional support strategies for improvement in courseware development for each of these three categories are explored and discussed. Future researchers are encouraged to test the developed institutional support strategies in their e-learning or blended learning practice.",The authors wish to acknowledge full funding for this research under Makerere University and Sweden Bi-lateral Programme (Mak-Sida) Grant No. 321.,"Lecture Notes of the Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering",e-Infrastructure and e-Services for Developing Countries,,2019-03-22,2019,275,,12-23,Closed,Chapter,"Oyo, Benedict; Maiga, Gilbert; Muyinda, Paul Birevu","Oyo, Benedict (Department of Computer Science, Gulu University, Gulu, Uganda); Maiga, Gilbert (Department of Information Technology, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda); Muyinda, Paul Birevu (Department of Open and Distance Learning, Makerere University, Kampala, Uganda)","Oyo, Benedict (Gulu University)","Oyo, Benedict (Gulu University); Maiga, Gilbert (Makerere University); Muyinda, Paul Birevu (Makerere University)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112905674,1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education,

Exploring variables associated with suicide attempts is important for the development of targeted interventions. The aim of the current study was to explore associations between leisure-time sedentary behavior and suicide attempts.
METHODS: Data from the Global School-based Student Health Survey were analyzed. Data on past 12-month suicide attempts and self-reported leisure-time sedentary time were collected. Multivariable logistic regression and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the associations.
RESULTS: Among 126,392 students from 43 countries (mean age 13.8 ± 0.96 years; 48.9% female), 10.6% had attempted suicide. The prevalence of suicide attempts increased with increasing sedentary leisure-time per day (from 9% at <1 h/day to 16.8% at >8 h/day). Compared to those engaging in <1 h/day sedentary during leisure-time, there was a dose-dependent increase in odds ratios (ORs) for suicide attempts, with the OR for >8 h/day being 1.45 (95% confidence interval=1.19-1.77).
LIMITATIONS: The study is cross-sectional, therefore the directionality of the relationships cannot be deduced.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that leisure-time sedentary behavior is associated with increased odds for suicide attempt in adolescence.

Understanding modifiable environmental risk factors is essential. There is evidence that physical activity is protective against sleep problems in adolescents. However, the association between sedentary behavior (SB) and anxiety-induced sleep disturbance has not been investigated.
METHODS: Using cross-sectional data from the Global school-based Student Health Survey, we explored the association between SB and anxiety-induced sleep disturbance in 181,093 adolescents [mean (standard deviation, SD) age 13.7 (1.0) years; 48.4% girls] from 67 countries, controlling for confounders (including physical activity). Adolescents reported anxiety-induced sleep disturbance during the past 12 months, and SB, which was a composite variable assessing time spent sitting and watching television, playing computer games, talking with friends during a typical day excluding the hours spent sitting at school and doing homework. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted and a countrywide meta-analysis undertaken.
RESULTS: Overall, 7.8% of adolescents had anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The prevalence of SB was: <1 h/day 39.9%; 1-2 h/day 33.8%; 3-4 h/day 15.4%; 5-8 h/day 7.4%; and >8 h/day 3.6%. Compared to <1 h/day of SB, >8 h/day was associated with a 2.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.98-2.62] times higher odds for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance. The association was similar among both sexes. The pooled odds ratio for anxiety-induced sleep disturbance when being sedentary ≥3 h/day was 1.42 (95% CI = 1.36-1.48) with only a small degree of between-country heterogeneity (I2 = 41.4%).

2,pub.1112747976,10.2478/environ-2019-0006,,,The role of wetland management agencies within the local community in the conservation of wetlands in Uganda,"Wetlands in Uganda are believed to be socio-economically important for providing water for drinking, irrigation, fisheries, recreation, transport and agriculture among others. Bearing in mind the host of benefits wetlands provide to local communities, if they are harnessed without the mind, they could end up being over utilized and ultimately degraded and not continue to provide a stream of functions, attributes and services. This could be one of the primary reasons why special Departments and Institutions like the National Environment Management Authority and Wetlands Management Department were created to manage the country’s natural resources including wetlands. The study was initiated to explore how wetland management agencies influence members of the local community on matters concerning the conservation of wetlands in Uganda. A cross-sectional research design was used to collect qualitative and quantitative data. A questionnaire survey was conducted amongst four hundred households to collect information concerning the role of wetland management agencies among members of the local community for the conservation of wetlands in Uganda. More information was obtained from senior officials from the National Environment Management Authority, Wetland Management Department, and District Natural Resources Officers from the study area using a non-structured questionnaire. Key informant interviews and direct observations were also used to collect data. The study revealed that gathering materials for building and for making crafts, agricultural activities, unsustainable mining of clay and sand for building contributed to wetland degradation. Some circumstances like high population growth, unclear wetland ownership, unawareness of the indirect functions of wetlands also contributed to wetland degradation. It was found that the wetland management agencies have been ineffective towards the conservation of wetlands mainly due to inadequate funding, political interference, and lack of specific judges for wetland related court cases among others. For wetland management agencies to effectively perform their duties leading to the protection and conservation of wetlands in Uganda, the study recommends that members of the local community should be allowed to practice wetland edge farming, fish farming in ponds constructed in wetlands, and to leave some parts of these vital wetlands that have been reclaimed to regenerate, in addition to addressing the main reported hindrances that are stifling the smooth running of the activities of the agencies.",,Environmental & Socio-economic Studies,,,2019-03-01,2019,7,1,59-74,All OA; Gold,Article,"Barakagira, Alex; de Wit, Anton H.","Barakagira, Alex (Faculty of Science, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University, P.O.

There is need to explore evidence-based, scalable interventions to compliment the “traditional” health care system. Physical activity (PA) can augment the effectiveness of existing programs. However, little is known about the perspectives of health care professionals on PA. Understanding this is key to implementation. Methods This was a qualitative exploratory study based on 13 key informant interviews among experienced health care professionals working at Butabika National Referral and Teaching Hospital, Uganda. Data was analyzed through content thematic analysis. Results Participants reported PA benefits were: improved individual competences and engagement, social reintegration and reduced family and community burden. Self-stigma, lack of community support, lack of infrastructure and equipment, lack of monitoring capacity, human resource challenges and a focus solely on pharmacotherapy were among the most reported barriers to application of PA in management of mental health problems. Conclusion Despite the high level of understanding of PA among health care professionals, PA promotion largely depends on implementation of strategies to deal with community and health systems barriers. Although patients need to be empowered to deal with their individual barriers, greater support and action is needed by policy makers. Public health programs should support PA through community engagement and social re-integration programs. The government should promote a holistic mental health care perspective and provide adequate infrastructural and human resources to support PA in the existing primary and mental health care systems.",The authors would like to thank the health care workers of the Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital who were interviewed for the purpose of this study.,Mental Health and Physical Activity,,,2019-03,2019,16,,1-7,Closed,Article,"Mugisha, James; De Hert, Marc; Knizek, Birthe Loa; Kwiringira, Japheth; Kinyanda, Eugene; Byansi, William; van Winkel, Ruud; Myin-Germeys, Inez; Stubbs, Brendon; Vancampfort, Davy","Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University, Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kampala, Uganda; Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); De Hert, Marc (University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium); Knizek, Birthe Loa (Norwegian University of Science and Technology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Trondheim, Norway); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University, Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kampala, Uganda); Kinyanda, Eugene (MRC/UVRI, Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Entebbe, Uganda; Department of Psychiatry, Makerere College of Health Sciences, Kampala, Uganda; Senior Welcome Trust Fellowship, London, United Kingdom); Byansi, William (Brown School of Social Work, Washington University, St. Louis, USA); van Winkel, Ruud (University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium; KU Leuven Centre of Contextual Psychiatry, Leuven, Belgium); Myin-Germeys, Inez (KU Leuven Centre of Contextual Psychiatry, Leuven, Belgium); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London, SE5 8AZ, United Kingdom; Department of Psychological Medicine, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, London, United Kingdom); Vancampfort, Davy (University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium; KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium)","Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)","Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University); De Hert, Marc (KU Leuven); Knizek, Birthe Loa (Norwegian University of Science and Technology); Kwiringira, Japheth (Kyambogo University); Kinyanda, Eugene (Uganda Virus Research Institute); Byansi, William (Washington University in St. Louis); van Winkel, Ruud (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Myin-Germeys, Inez (KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven)",2,2,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112381827,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

It is anchored in the interpretive lens and the data was derived from three state-sponsored reports on the two public universities. The secondary data were analyzed using content analysis. The findings demonstrate that the size, composition, authority, and effectiveness of the university council and the senate and the mode through which leaders assume office, are the salient governance concerns in the two universities. The results further show that, stakeholders’ concerns regarding the current shared governance framework for public universities relate to the substance of the framework rather than its form or the framework itself. This suggests that the governance framework comprising the university council, the university senate and the administration is fit for purpose and in sync with the nature of the academy. Arguably, these governance organs (and the nature of their work) set a university apart from other organisations. Finally, without being prescriptive, the article sketches options for reform.Le présent article se concentre sur l’Université de Makerere et l’Université de Kyambogo pour mettre en lumière l’inquiétude des parties prenantes au sujet du modèle de gouvernance partagée dans les universités publiques en Ouganda.

Les données secondaires ont été traitées par une analyse de contenu. Les résultats démontrent que la taille, la composition, l’autorité et l’efficacité du conseil universitaire et du sénat de l’université, et la façon dont les dirigeants exercent leurs fonctions sont les principaux sujets d’inquiétude en ce qui concerne la gouvernance de ces deux universités. Les résultats démontrent également que les inquiétudes des parties prenantes au sujet du modèle actuel de gouvernance partagée des universités publiques porte sur le contenu de ce modèle, plus que sur sa forme ou sur le modèle lui-même. Cela montre que le modèle de gouvernance qui comprend le conseil universitaire, le sénat de l’université et l’administration répond aux attentes et est en cohérence avec l’environnement académique.On peut considérer que ces organes de gouvernance (et la nature de leur travail) différencient l’université d’autres types d’organisations.

As such, violence against women and girls thrives on deprivation, poverty, acceptance and concealment coupled with women’s dependence on men and male-dominated decision-making in most spheres of life. Even with increased awareness about VAWG, there was a fear to lose ‘care’ among women and custody over their children, which kept violence unreported and hidden. In practice, for policies and programmes to be effective, the multiple vulnerabilities of being female, mothers, poor, illiterate, married and the limitations on access and control over household and communal resources as intersectionalities need to be addressed.

We employed a quasi experiment where the Marquardt Action Learning model was combined with the constructivist theories of learning. The quasi experiment was composed of three groups, namely the treatment group (action learning group), the traditional group and the control group. To stimulate participant thought and reflection, a community of practice environment was created and just-in-time classes were conducted, based on the constructive theories of learning. Although the study involved various constructivist theories, the article concentrates on problem-based learning; hence, it is quiet about other constructivist theories. The results indicate significant differences between the action learning and traditional didactic learning. Furthermore, a significant relationship between problem-based learning and action learning was established. The robust strength of reflective practice and self-directed learning in the prediction of action learning is also highlighted.

Eventually, hydrological modelers are confronted with the difficulty of ensuring both the observed high flows and low flows are accurately reproduced in a single calibration. This study introduced Hydrological Model focusing on Sub-flows’ Variation (HMSV). Calibration of HMSV follows a carefully designed framework comprising sub-flow’s separation, modeling of sub-flows, and checking validity of hydrological extremes. The introduced model and calibration framework were tested using hydro-meteorological data from the Blue Nile Basin from Ethiopia in Africa. When the conventional calibration approach was adopted through automatic optimization strategy, results from the HMSV were found highly comparable with those of five internationally well recognized hydrological models (AWBM, IHACRES, SACRAMENTO, SIMHYD, and TANK). The new framework enhanced the HMSV performance for reproducing quantiles of both high flows and low flows. The combination of flow separation and step-wise calibration of hydrological model against sub-flows enhances the modeler’s physical insight in identifying which areas need focus in modeling to obtain meaningful simulation results, especially of extreme events. The link for downloading the HMSV is provided.","Apart from the introduced HMSV, the other hydrological models were obtained from the “eWater Toolkit” of the Cooperative Research Centre for Catchment Hydrology in Australia via the link http://www.toolkit.net.au/ (accessed on 25 August 2015).

This volume thus serves both as a practical introduction to corpus compilation (Part I of the book), corpus-based research (Part II) and the application of corpora in language teaching (Part III), and is intended both for those researchers not yet familiar with corpus linguistics and as a reference work for all international researchers investigating the linguistic properties of African Englishes.",,Studies in Corpus Linguistics,,,2019-01-28,2019,88,,,"All OA; Green, Published",Edited Book,,,,,0,0,,,http://repository.uwc.ac.za/xmlui/bitstream/10566/5247/1/Antia_Hendricks%202019%20proofs_semiotic%20signatures_2019.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111785469,"2004 Linguistics; 20 Language, Communication and Culture",

Although there have been standard methods for the identification of parameters of synchronous and induction machines, most of them do not apply to LSPMSMs. This paper presents a study and analysis of different parameter identification methods for interior mount LSPMSM. Experimental tests have been performed in the laboratory on a 1-hp interior mount LSPMSM. The measurements have been validated by investigating the performance of the machine under different operating conditions using a developed qd0 mathematical model and an experimental setup. The dynamic and steady-state performance analyses have been performed using the determined parameters. It is found that the experimental results are close to the mathematical model results, confirming the accuracy of the studied test methods. Therefore, the output of this study will help in selecting the proper test method for LSPMSM.",The authors acknowledge the support from the King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST) through the Science and Technology Unit at KFUPM on a Project grant No. 13-ENE403-04.,Machines,,,2019-01-07,2019,7,1,4,All OA; Gold,Article,"Maraaba, Luqman S.; Al-Hamouz, Zakariya M.; Milhem, Abdulaziz S.; Twaha, Ssennoga","Maraaba, Luqman S.

The Revised Primary Teacher Education Curriculum of 2013 marked an ambitious yet inconclusive attempt to advance the implementation of inclusive education but has encountered deeply entrenched sociocultural exclusionary practices among education experts.
Objectives: This study aimed to explicate education practitioners' interpretations of Uganda's flagship inclusive education programme in preservice primary teacher education.
Method: Drawing on the conceptual vocabulary of frame analysis and the qualitative analysis of individual and group interviews and classroom observations, the interpretations of inclusive education implementation in preservice primary teacher education in Uganda were examined. The participants included policy design experts, curriculum design experts and classroom practitioners.
Results: Three main findings emerged. Firstly, interpretations of inclusive education displayed a narrow framing heuristic of inclusive education as a perfunctory, daily practice rather than a pathway for reflective, inclusive pedagogical engagement. Secondly, the heuristic encouraged the treatment of inclusive pedagogy as a 'label' under a specific rubric referring to sensory impairments or disabilities - a historical device for sociocultural exclusion. Thirdly, inclusive education was a praxis but was misframed from its original intentions, causing tension and resentment among practitioners. These findings contribute to the debates on the sustainability of inclusive education beyond preservice teacher education.
Conclusion: Uganda's flagship inclusive education programme in preservice primary teacher education was fraught with tensions, ambiguities and an overt, urgent need for change.","Acknowledgements

In contrast, persons with disability were accepted in ancient Africa and their disorder was not shown as a physical handicap.
Objectives: The objective of this article was to critically examine how disability is constructed in philosophy and religion in comparison with African culture, in the shaping of disability identity as a form of humanity.
Method: This article undertook a document review of both grey and peer reviewed literature. The papers reviewed were identified and screened for relevance, then analysed with the aim of comparing the portrayal of disability in philosophy, religion and ancient Africa.
Results: Our analysis revealed that African cultures revered the disability identity, as opposed to philosophy and religion that portrayed it as abnormal. A person with disability was accepted in ancient Africa and given a visible role in society suggesting their integration in daily life activities while their disability was believed to be a blessing from the gods.
Conclusion: Religion and philosophy have incredibly alienated persons with disabilities with linguistic and derogative identities. Whereas African spiritualism inherently glorified and/or approved disability, in today's Africa, persons with disability are increasingly objectified and abused because of ignorance and harsh economic conditions. Nevertheless, the contemporary mistreatment of people with disabilities (PWDs) does not reflect a true African culture but is a symptom and a consequence of the material and economic injustice that PWDs encounter.

This study contributes to the characterization effort by determining the levels and number of generations to common ancestors (""age"") associated with inbreeding in African goat breeds and identifies regions that contain copy number variation mistyped as being homozygous. Illumina 50k single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data for 608 goats from 31 breeds were used to compute the level and age of inbreeding at both local (marker) and global levels (FG) using a model-based approach based on a hidden Markov model. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) segments detected using the Viterbi algorithm led to ROH-based inbreeding coefficients for all ROH (FROH) and for ROH longer than 2 Mb (FROH > 2Mb). Some of the genomic regions identified as having ROH are likely to be hemizygous regions (copy number deletions) mistyped as homozygous regions. Although the proportion of these miscalled ROH is small and does not substantially affect estimates of levels of inbreeding for individual animals, the inbreeding metrics were adjusted by removing these regions from the ROH. All the inbreeding metrics varied widely across breeds, with overall means of 0.0408, 0.0370, and 0.0691 and medians of 0.0125, 0.0098, and 0.0366 for FROH, FROH > 2Mb, and FG, respectively.

The study design was a cross-sectional survey, data were analysed using SPSS and Analysis of Moment Structure on a sample of 228 SMEs. The mediated model provides support for the hypothesis that ecologies of innovation partially mediate the relationship between entrepreneurial networking and opportunity exploitation. This confirms that the presence of ecologies of innovation significantly acts as a conduit in the association between entrepreneurial networking and opportunity exploitation. The practical implications are that opportunity exploitation can be understood and predicted through ecologies of innovation, entrepreneurial networking can also predict opportunity exploitation directly. Business owners and managers need to fully understand and utilise the ecologies of innovation to exploit opportunities effectively. Social implications, a deeper understanding of how entrepreneurial networking and ecologies of innovation affect employee relations will not be fully realised until employers create a platform for rational thinking, creativity and learning about this interaction.

A qualitative approach using in-depth interviews and reflective logs provided the study framework. The results showed several challenges faced by the university in administering learner support: a limited number of full-time staff at the faculty, lack of a reading culture, poor citations and referencing styles by students, untimely communication, and failure of some students to attend faculty field support. Further analysis revealed challenges of organising successful face-to-face workshops, inadequate counselling and guidance, inadequate action research supervision, students’ lack of ICT skills, inadequate library support, limited financial resource base, inadequate faculty support from the university management, and limited distance learners’ representation in their leadership and governance.

To empirically validate the conceptual model and test the hypothesised relationships, the authors collected data from a sample of 228 SMEs in Kampala district, Uganda purposefully selected for this study. A cross-sectional survey design was adopted, and data were analysed using SPSS/20 and AMOS version 23. The findings exhibit a full mediation of ecologies of innovation in the relationship between informational differences and entrepreneurial networking among SMEs. Besides, informational differences and entrepreneurial networking are insignificantly related. There were, however, some limitations: as the study was cross-sectional in nature, it was difficult to trace the process of interactions among employees especially, how they attach meaning to information and entrepreneurial networking patterns over time;—the study was conducted in Kampala district among trade, manufacturing, and services sectors only. The implication is that entrepreneurial networking can only be explained and predicted through ecologies of innovation. The study recommends that SME owners/managers need to fully understand and facilitate ecologies of innovation for employees to interact and attach meaning to information. This research contributes to the literature on mediation of ecologies of innovation between informational differences and entrepreneurial networking through its empirical findings of the hypothesised relationships.

Besides, the finding also indicated that there is a significant and positive relationship between psychological capital and happiness at the workplace. The findings correspond to the argument that in the face of the variety of theoretical and practical implications provided, there is a need for professional workers to be innately involved in their work if their psychological capital is to affect their level of happiness at the workplace.

These metals restrict the use of sludge in agriculture because their accumulation is harmful to the environment and particularly the food chain. Cadmium and lead are among the most common heavy metals found in municipal wastewater treatment plant sludge. They are capable of bioaccumulation in plant tissues like roots and leaves and are non-biodegradable and therefore they remain in the sludge which is disposed on land or used as fertilizers on farms. The presence of heavy metal pollutants serves as a great threat to soils and also makes plants grown on such soils unfit for animal and human consumption as they may have detrimental effects to animal and human life. For instance, Pb and Cd are known to be human carcinogens. This study therefore aimed to investigate the levels of Cd and Pb in the treated dry sludge from Lubigi Feacal Sludge and Wastewater treatment plant located in Kawempe division, Kampala city, Uganda so as to ascertain its safety for use on agricultural lands. Two batches of samples were collected and analyzed at Government Analytical laboratory in Wandegeya, Uganda. The acid digested sludge samples were analyzed using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS) method. The average concentrations of Pb found in collected sludge samples, batch 1 (11.912 mg/kg dm) and batch 2 (5.304 mg/kg dm) were far below the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) maximum permissible concentration (840 mg/kg) for any land application. Cadmium was not detected in all the sludge samples collected; there is an implication that it is either completely absent in the sludge generated by the plant or present but far below detectable levels. The sludge generated from Lubigi fecal sludge and wastewater treatment plant is therefore safe for application on agricultural lands as far as Pb and Cd concentrations are concerned.",,Journal of Water Resource and Protection,,,2019,2019,11,6,690-699,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kyayesimira, Juliet; Ssemaganda, Abbey; Muhwezi, Godfrey; Andama, Morgan","Kyayesimira, Juliet (); Ssemaganda, Abbey (); Muhwezi, Godfrey (); Andama, Morgan ()",,"Kyayesimira, Juliet (); Ssemaganda, Abbey (); Muhwezi, Godfrey (); Andama, Morgan ()",1,1,,,http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=92940,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116866148,09 Engineering; 0907 Environmental Engineering,

2,pub.1121429410,10.2139/ssrn.3454396,,,An Empirical Test of the Agency Theory in Corporate Governance of SACCOs in Uganda,"In organizations, the principal (owners) hire agents (management) for the purpose of producing goods and services. Each party in a firm has a unique goal. For example, as the principal seeks to maximize dividends, agents cherish utility maximization from their status and claims for non-pecuniary benefits. While executing their roles and obligations, management may consider fulfilling their interests at the expense of the owners, and vice versa. Management misconduct results in agency problems. This study tests the relevance of the agency theory and examines whether existing corporate governance mechanisms address agency problems in Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOs) in Uganda. Inquiry follows a mixed research (both quantitative and qualitative) design by use of self-administered questionnaires and personal interviews. The key informants are selected through a stratified sampling procedure. Questions are asked about the agency problems emanating from: the utility of owners and management, financial challenges, and information asymmetry; and governance mechanisms. Respondents’ views and perceptions are analyzed using a 5-point Likert scale. From a sample of 252 SACCOs, each with a minimum of ten years of experience, findings show that majority (40%) operate in Western Uganda, have a minimum of 1,000 shareholders, 65.1% of the Board has at least a first degree, and a dominance male (91.7%) in management. The average welfare index for the owners (4=bad welfare) is lower than that of the management (2.7=good welfare) signaling presence of conflicts. The board composition shows less CEO duality, bigger size, more independence, higher remuneration, and presence of audit committees. Examining whether this structure impacts on the agency conflicts, the marginal effects from the probit regression indicate that the board size, remuneration, and independence have a high likelihood of reducing the principal-agent problems while the audit committee yields a reverse sign. Therefore, there is need for the adoption of good corporate governance practices in SACCOs for survival.",,SSRN Electronic Journal,,,2019,2019,,,,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Preprint,"Muhanguzi, Kibs Boaz","Muhanguzi, Kibs Boaz (Kampala International University, College of Economics and Management Sciences, Department of Business Management; Makerere University)",,"Muhanguzi, Kibs Boaz ()",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1121429410,"1501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 15 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Moreover, it includes contributions on how to promote the climate agenda and biodiversity conservation at the local level. Climate change as a whole and global warming in particular are known to have a negative impact on biodiversity in three main ways. Firstly, increases in temperatures are detrimental to a number of organisms, especially those in sensitive habitats such as coral reefs and rainforests. Secondly, the pressures posed by a changing climate may lead to sets of responses in areas as varied as phenology, range and physiology of living organisms, often leading to changes in their lifecycles (especially but not only in reproduction), losses in productivity or even death. In some cases, the very survival of very sensitive species may be endangered. Thirdly, the impacts of climate change on biodiversity will be felt in the short term with regard to some species and ecosystems, but also in the medium and long term in many biomes. Indeed, if left unchecked, some of these impacts may be irreversible. Many individual governments, financial institutes and international donors are currently spending billions of dollars on projects addressing climate change and biodiversity, but with little coordination. Quite often, the emphasis is on adaptation efforts, with little emphasis on the connections between physio-ecological changes and the lifecycles and metabolisms of fauna and flora, or the influence of poor governance on biodiversity. As such, there is a recognized need to not only better understand the impacts of climate change on biodiversity, but to also identify, test and implement measures aimed at managing the many risks that climate change poses to fauna, flora and micro-organisms. In particular, the question of how to restore and protect ecosystems from the impact of climate change also has to be urgently addressed. This book was written to address this need. The respective papers explore matters related to the use of an ecosystem-based approach to increase local adaptation capacity, consider the significance of a protected areas network in preserving biodiversity in a changing northern European climate, and assess the impacts of climate change on specific species, including wild terrestrial animals. The book also presents a variety of case studies such as the Yellowstone to Yukon Conservation Initiative, the effects of climate change on the biodiversity of Aleppo pine forest in Senalba (Algeria), climate change and biodiversity response in the Niger Delta region, and the effects of forest fires on the biodiversity and the soil characteristics of tropical peatlands in Indonesia.

A randomized controlled trial,"BackgroundSeveral cost-effective programs are being implemented around the world that use mobile technology to improve Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH) uptake and awareness among youth. Mobile phone applications are a viable and effective means of increasing access to SRH services and tools in low and middle-income countries. This paper presents a protocol for a pilot study of a novel program, a mobile phone-based sexual and reproductive health services awareness and delivery application with the objective of increasing the demand for SRH services amongst the youth in Uganda.MethodsThe study employs rigorous evaluation methods to ascertain the impact of the mobile application. We propose a randomized control trial study to determine the causal effect of the mobile phone app in creating awareness and increasing uptake of sexual and reproductive health services in Uganda. The main outcome of the impact evaluation is the percentage change in the SRH services and tools uptake, SRH knowledge and sexual behavior. We will also conduct a model-based incremental cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) and budget impact analysis (BIA). The main outcomes of the economic evaluation will be the average cost per app user, cost per app service and tool provided. We will also test the in-app advertising model as a way to generate revenue to sustain the program subsidies and related costs.DiscussionThe study seeks to establish the proof of concept of using a mobile application to increase create awareness and increase uptake of SRH tools and services among youth in Uganda. The study results will lead to the development of a demand-driven, culturally-relevant, and easy-to-use mobile app to enhance the uptake of SRH services among the youth in Uganda and globally.Trial registrationMUREC1/7 No. 07/05–18.

The population increase poses a serious challenge of increasing food supply to meet the future demand. This challenge is compounded by climate change impacts on agriculture. In this paper, how poverty contributes to household food insecurity is explored and measures suggested to help address this challenge. To plan adaptation measures, linkages among food insecurity, poverty, and illiteracy should be considered. For the sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA), adaptation (focused on poverty alleviation) should be prioritized and preferred to mitigation. Enhancement of adaptive capacity should not only be tailored toward empowerment of women but also made highly localized to household levels. Generally, efforts could be geared toward yield gap closure, addressing challenges regarding food distribution, promoting non‐farm income‐generating activities, and unification of government priorities in agriculture and food security. Government in each country of the SSA should ensure that governance strongly embraces transparency, accountability, and integrity otherwise as it is said a fish rots from the head down. Estimates of uncertainty in predicting future climate and their implications on expenditure related to adaptation should to always be made in an integrated way and reported to support actionable policies. To increase credibility in climate prediction especially at local scales, advances toward improving climate models (for instance by refining spatiotemporal scales, enhancing models’ capacity to reproduce observed natural variability in key climatological variables like rainfall) should be made, and this requires support from the investment in climate science. Science–policy interfacing is required in planning and implementation of measures for adapting to climate change impacts. In summary, food insecurity and persistent poverty especially in the SSA should be of direct relevance and concern at a global scale. Thus, global collaboration in science is key to achieve food security in the SSA. African food insecurity challenge is compounded by climate change impacts on agriculture. Addressing the challenge requires an interplay of the science and policy roles. Above all, global collaboration in science is key to achieving food security in the sub‐Saharan Africa.",,Food and Energy Security,,,2018-12-12,2018,8,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Onyutha, Charles","Onyutha, Charles (Department of Civil and Building Engineering, Kyambogo University, Kyambogo, Uganda; Faculty of Technoscience, Muni University, Arua, Uganda)",,"Onyutha, Charles (Kyambogo University; Muni University)",7,5,,3.14,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/fes3.160,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110578800,"0703 Crop and Pasture Production; 0503 Soil Sciences; 0701 Agriculture, Land and Farm Management; 05 Environmental Sciences; 07 Agricultural and Veterinary Sciences",2 Zero Hunger; 1 No Poverty; 13 Climate Action

The article also describes the future of the profession. Through a review of documents and key informant interviews, it is noted that Environmental Health in Uganda dates back to colonial times when the country was affected by diseases including plague, trypanosomiasis and small pox. Concerted efforts were advanced to train cadres that would improve the sanitation status and address the prevailing disease burden. Over several decades, the Environmental Health profession has evolved in many areas of training, practice, research and governance, policy and legal framework amidst several challenges. The future of Environmental Health in Uganda will require more advanced training and research, broadened practice, and streamlined governance.","The authors recognize the contribution of senior Environmental Health colleagues who provided key information that contributed to this article.

A survey was conducted in five farming systems in Uganda to isolate entomopathogens associated with X. compactus. Four fungal isolates were screened for virulence against X. compactus in the laboratory at 1 × 107 conidia ml-1 where an atoxigenic L-strain of A. flavus killed 70%-100% of all stages of X. compactus compared with other unidentified isolates which caused 20%-70% mortalities. The time taken by A. flavus to kill 50% of X. compactus eggs, larvae, pupae and adults in the laboratory was 2-3 days; whereas the other unidentified fungal isolates took 4-7 days. The concentrations of A. flavus that killed 50% of different stages of X. compactus were 5 × 105 , 12 × 105 , 17 × 105 and 30 × 105 conidia ml-1 for larvae, eggs, pupae and adults respectively. A formulation of A. flavus in oil caused higher mortalities of X. compactus larvae, pupae and adults in the field (71%-79%) than its formulation in water (33%-47%). The atoxigenic strain of A. flavus could therefore be developed into a safe biopesticide against X. compactus.","The authors thank the Director NaCORI W. W.

This study assessed the extent of historical, current, and future land use systems in Uganda. The specific objectives were to (i) characterize and assess the extent of historical and current land use systems, and (ii) project future lan use systems. The land use systems were defined and classified using spatially explicit land use/cover layers for the years 1990 and 2015, while the future prediction (for the year 2040) was determined using land use systems datasets for both years through a Markov chain model. This study reveals a total of 29 classes of land use systems that can be broadly categorized as follows: three of the land use systems are agricultural, five are under bushland, four under forest, five under grasslands, two under impediments, three under wetlands, five under woodland, one under open water and urban settlement respectively. The highest gains in the land amongst the land use systems were experienced in subsistence agricultural land and grasslands protected, while the highest losses were seen in grasslands unprotected and woodland/forest with low livestock densities. By 2040, subsistence agricultural land is likely to increase by about 1% while tropical high forest with livestock activities is expected to decrease by 0.2%, and woodland/forest unprotected by 0.07%. High demand for agricultural and settlement land are mainly responsible for land use systems patchiness. This study envisages more land degradation and disasters such as landslides, floods, droughts, and so forth to occur in the country, causing more deaths and loss of property, if the rate at which land use systems are expanding is not closely monitored and regulated in the near future.","The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), which took lead in the study, acknowledges the tremendous support received from the REDD+ secretariat, the UNREDD team, and the national stakeholders that provided input during the consultative workshops (at Protea Hotel and Hotel Africana in Kampala), as well as the Mt.

However, the effects of plant diets on lipid content and fatty acid composition of R. differens are not well understood. We tested the effects of four diets on the total lipid content and fatty acid composition of R. differens. Sixth instar nymphs of R. differens were reared on one, and mixtures of two, three, and six natural plant inflorescences. Individuals collected from the field constituted a control treatment. We extracted lipids and analyzed the fatty acid methyl esters using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. We analyzed if the total lipid content, body weight, and fatty acid composition differed among diets and between the sexes using two‐way ANOVAs and a PERMANOVA model, respectively. The total lipid content and weight of R. differens did not differ among the diets. The nine common fatty acids were palmitic (mean across treatments, 26%), oleic (22%), palmitoleic (18%), linoleic (13%), stearic (7%), myristic (6%), myristoleic (4%), α‐linolenic (2%) and arachidic acid (1%). The composition of fatty acids and the proportion of essential fatty acids significantly differed among the diets. The proportion of essential fatty acids was highest in the control treatment (21%) but low in less diversified (one to three feed) diets (12–13%). This study demonstrates that the fatty acid composition in R. differens can be influenced through diet. Thus, with dietary manipulations, using local plants in Africa, it is possible to produce R. differens with preferred high quality essential fatty acids for human consumption.","We are grateful to Uganda National Council of Science and Technology for permitting the study and Makerere University Agricultural Research Institute, Kabanyolo for hosting the project.

Differences in damage levels and pesticide response across regions led to the postulation that there might be considerable variation between banana weevil populations (biotypes) with varying levels of virulence. One of the most sustainable options for banana weevil control is the use of host plant resistance. While new resistant varieties are being developed through both conventional crossbreeding and biotechnology, there is a need to assess the genetic variation of banana weevil populations from eastern, central, southern, southwestern and midwest regions of Uganda to determine whether there are biotypes with different virulence levels. This would help guide new control strategies to target all the possible biotypes. The amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) technique was used to analyze population genetic diversity using four primer combinations (EcoRI/MSeI).ResultsAnalysis of molecular variance results presented no evidence to support significant genetic variability among the banana weevil populations from eastern, central, southern, southwestern and midwest regions. Practically, all the genetic variation was found to reside within populations (97% for sites and 98% for regions), with only approximately 3% and 2% residing among populations of sites and regions, respectively.Conclusions and recommendationsAFLP markers clustered the banana weevils into two distinct populations consequently supporting the hypothesis of possible presence of banana weevil biotypes in Uganda. However, attempts should be made to make follow-up studies on the seemingly unique population of eastern Uganda using more robust molecular techniques to establish whether the eastern Uganda population constitutes a different biotype.",,Agriculture & Food Security,,,2018-10-23,2018,7,1,76,All OA; Gold,Article,"Twesigye, Charles K.; Ssekatawa, Kenneth; Kiggundu, Andrew; Tushemereirwe, Wilberforce; Matovu, Enock","Twesigye, Charles K.

Seventy-nine (79) tissue culture plantlets and fifty (50) suckers were established in buckets in a randomized complete block design for 5 months. Ten adult weevils (5 females and 5 males) were introduced at the base of each plant, and the buckets were covered with a weevil proof mesh. Weevil damage was estimated as a percentage at 60 days after the weevil introduction by estimating the peripheral damage (PD), total cross section corm damage (XT) and above the collar damage (ACD).ResultsThe results showed high differences in the PD, XI, XO and XT caused by weevils from the different zones. PD and XT ranged from 4.8–50.4 to 4.2–43.8%, respectively, caused by weevils collected from Kabale and Rakai, Kabale and Wakiso, respectively, while XI and XO varied from 0.0–42.9 to 8.3–40.4%, respectively, caused by banana weevils collected from Kabale and Rakai, Kabale and Rakai, respectively. Banana weevils from Rakai caused the highest ACD of 40.4% and no such damage was caused by banana weevils collected from western Uganda. Average ACD in suckers was 19.6% and significantly higher than that in tissue culture plants (8.5%).Conclusions and recommendationsCorm damage assessment suggests the existence of banana weevil biotypes but it is recommended that follow-up studies be carried out to confirm this phenomenon.",,Agriculture & Food Security,,,2018-10-19,2018,7,1,73,All OA; Gold,Article,"Twesigye, Charles K.; Ssekatawa, Kenneth; Kiggundu, Andrew; Tushemereirwe, Wilberforce; Matovu, Enock; Karamura, Eldad","Twesigye, Charles K.

However, this routine demotivates many librarians who have the potential and enthusiasm to make an impact on national development. Climate change is one of the most challenging global occurrences. It greatly affects many developmental activities such as agriculture, on which over 80% of Uganda’s population thrives. The aim of this paper is to assess and recommend innovative ways through which librarians can practically participate in the mitigation of climate change effects in the country in addition to information dissemination. The study used a cross-sectional survey of librarians in Uganda and realised a response rate of 95.5%, with most respondents from academic institutions and their primary role mainly (83.7%) as librarians. It was established that the majority (55.8%) was aware of the 2030 United Nations (UN) Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Also observed was that air pollution, toxic pollutants and deforestation are the key causes of environmental degradation in Uganda. Librarians should be repositioned to promote products and services which assist in reducing waste as well as promoting awareness campaigns for waste reduction and education. This initiative, however, is expected to be affected by challenges such as poverty and the subsistence needs of the communities as well as conflicting priorities of the people and government.",,,Going Green: Implementing Sustainable Strategies in Libraries Around the World,,2018-10-05,2018,,,197-209,Closed,Chapter,"Mulumba, Onan; Akullo, Winny Nekesa","Mulumba, Onan (); Akullo, Winny Nekesa ()",,"Mulumba, Onan (); Akullo, Winny Nekesa ()",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1107468043,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

1,pub.1104292643,10.1016/j.worlddev.2018.05.022,,,Why education is not helping the poor. Findings from Uganda,"Education emerged as a nearly uncontested development strategy to tackle several forms of social, political, economic and geographic inequalities in low- and middle-income countries. When it comes to the case of Uganda, the country represents a striking paradox. Significant investments and policy reforms in education (such as Universal Primary and Secondary Education) since 1997, did not translate into the expected results with regards to poverty reduction through human capital investment. Progress in poverty alleviation is not only stagnant but the role of education therein can be described as ‘modest’ at best. Against this backdrop, this article assesses the following research question: Why did Uganda’s investments and policy reforms in education not uplift the poor? In examining the issue, this article introduces a theoretical framework that contrasts assimilative with transformative approaches in poverty alleviation through education. A rigorous review of Uganda’s education sector plans revealed that current strategies to reduce poverty revolve around a strong assimilation-based development agenda, thereby focusing on three main areas of intervention: (a) increased access to education and retention; (b) improved quality of education; and (c) employment generation through education. The article finds that these assimilative approaches do not have an impact on the political, economic and social structures that cause poverty in the first place. Hence, it concludes that assimilative models in education are highly dependent on transformative approaches. Concretely, change cannot emerge only at the very grassroots level, i.e. through educating society at large, but also has to arise from the systemic level, i.e. government institutions at the local, national and global levels. Methodologically, the analysis draws on qualitative data that was collected in the course of two extensive field research stays in 2015 and 2017. In addition, quantitative data in the form of statistical abstracts inform the analysis.",,World Development,,,2018-10,2018,110,,124-139,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Datzberger, Simone","Datzberger, Simone (UCL (University College London), IoE (Institute of Education), CEID (Centre for Education and International Development, 20 Bedford Way, WC1H 0AL, London)",,"Datzberger, Simone (University College London)",16,16,,15.89,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10050399/1/Datzberger%20Why%20education%20is%20not%20helping%20the%20poor%20REVISED_DRAFT_no_TC.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104292643,1605 Policy and Administration; 14 Economics; 16 Studies in Human Society; 1403 Econometrics; 1608 Sociology; 1402 Applied Economics,1 No Poverty; 10 Reduced Inequalities

They are used to treat conditions and infections ranging from inflammations, pains and fevers to viruses, bacteria, protozoans and parasites. Two of the plants, V. amygdalina and M. foetida, are also used as human food or relish, while others are important in ethnoveterinary practices and in zoopharmacognosy in the wild. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro antiplasmodial, antitrypanosomal and antileishmanial activities, along with cytotoxicity of the multi-component extracts of these plants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Different parts of the plants were prepared and serially extracted with hexane, petroleum ether, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methanol and double distilled water. Solvent free extracts were assayed for in vitro inhibition against four reference parasite strains, Plasmodium falciparum (K1), Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (STIB 900), Trypanosoma cruzi (Talahuen C2C4) and Leishmania donovani (MHOM-ET-67/L82) using standard methods. Toxicity was assessed against L6 skeletal fibroblast and mouse peritoneal macrophage (J774) cells and selectivity indices (SIs) calculated for the most active extracts.
RESULTS: The strongest activities, demonstrating median inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ≤ 2 μg/ml, were observed for the dichloromethane and petroleum ether extracts of K. anthotheca, B. adoensis and S. pinnata. Overall, IC50 values ranged from  90 μg/ml. Out of 22 extracts demonstrating IC50s  3.3 and >10 μg/ml), and nine against P. falciparum (IC50: 0.96 μg/ml to 4.69 μg/ml). Selectivity indices (SI) calculated for the most active extracts ranged from <1.00 to 94.24. However, the B. adoensis leaf dichloromethane extract (a) was equipotent (IC50 = 3.3 μg/ml) against L. donovani and L6 cells respectively, indicating non-specific selection. Trypanosome and Plasmodium parasites were comparatively more sensitive to the test extracts.
CONCLUSIONS: The benefits achieved from the seven tested plant species as traditional ethnomedicinal and ethnoveterinary therapies or in zoopharmacognosy against infections and conditions of animals in the wild are strongly supported by results of this study. The synergy of plant extracts, so achieved by concerted actions of the ligands, produces adequate perturbation of targets in the four parasite genera, resulting in the strong potencies exhibited by low IC50 values. The total inhibitory effect, achieved as a sum of perturbations contributed by each participating compound in the extract, minimises toxic effects of the compounds as seen in the high SI's obtained with some extracts. Those extracts demonstrating SI ≥ 4 form promising candidates for further cell-based and system pharmacology studies.","This work was supported by a research grant from the Staff development program of Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.

We sought to describe the specific contexts underpinning the endurance of vertical HIV clinics in Uganda.MethodsA qualitative research design was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the heads of HIV clinics, clinicians and facility in-charges (n = 78), coupled with eight focus group discussions (64 participants) with patients from 16 health facilities purposively selected, from a nationally-representative sample of 195 health facilities across Uganda, because they run stand-alone HIV clinics. Data were analyzed by thematic approach as guided by the theory proposed by Shediac-Rizkallah & Bone (1998) which identifies; Intervention characteristics, organizational context, and broader environment factors as potentially influential on health programme sustainability.ResultsIntervention characteristics: Provider stigma was reported to have been widespread in the integrated care experience of participating health facilities which necessitated the establishment of stand-alone HIV clinics. HIV disease management was described as highly specialized which necessitated a dedicated workforce and vertical HIV infrastructure such as counselling rooms. Organizational context: Participating health facilities reported health-system capacity constraints in implementing integrated systems of care due to a shortage of ART-proficient personnel and physical space, a lack of laboratory capacity to concurrently conduct HIV and non-HIV tests and increased workloads associated with implementing integrated care. Broader environment factors: Escalating HIV client loads and external HIV funding architectures were perceived to have perpetuated verticalized HIV programming over the past decade.ConclusionOur study offers in-depth, contextualized insights into the factors contributing to the endurance of vertical HIV clinics in Uganda. Our analysis suggests that there is a complex interaction in supply-side constraints (shortage of ART-proficient personnel, increased workloads, laboratory capacity deficiencies) and demand-side factors (escalating demand for HIV services, psychosocial barriers to HIV care) as well as the specialized nature of HIV disease management which pose challenges to the integrated-health services agenda.","AcknowledgementsWe are very thankful to all HIV clinic managers, clinicians and patients who took time from their busy schedules to participate in this study.FundingThis research was supported by the Consortium for Advanced Research Training in Africa (CARTA).

The basin provides resources for fishing, agriculture, medicine, forestry, water transport and other economic activities. However, its area is grossly affected by climate change due to population growth, urbanization, industrialization, increasing commercial activities and inadequate provision of sanitation services which have caused a lot of pollution. This climate change is likely to lead to loss of biodiversity in terms of species richness. Moreover, the increase in the population growth around Lake Victoria Basin is associated with an increase in economic activities that lead to ecosystem vulnerability and social-ecological disequilibrium. Climate change is likely to affect biodiversity as species struggle to adapt to climatic changes. In order to address the issue of climate change, proper communication and information sharing among the stakeholders around the Lake Victoria Basin is paramount. This paper addresses this need, by discussing major socio-economic activities taking place around this Basin, their impact on climate change and its impact on biodiversity thereof, and problems related to resource management. The study took place in the districts of Buikwe and Mayuge in Uganda. Qualitative and quantitative research approaches were used, data collected was analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science research software. From the findings, there are variations in access to communication gadgets, mobile phones being top on the list of accessibility. The study concludes by identifying the best option for communication and information sharing based on the factors evaluated and recommends an integrated web-based and mobile application tool for better management of resource in Lake Victoria Basin.","Many thanks goes to the local communities and leaders in the study areas for cooperating with us in providing the reliable information necessary for this study.

In this study, we validated an electrochemical immunosensor device by the on-site detection of 60 maize flour samples from six markets and 72 samples from households in Kampala. The immunosensor was successfully validated with a linear range from 0.7 ± 0.1 to 11 ± 0.3 µg/kg and limit of detection (LOD) of 0.7 µg/kg. The maize flour samples from the markets had a mean total aflatoxin concentration of 7.6 ± 2.3 µg/kg with approximately 20% of the samples higher than 10 µg/kg, which is the maximum acceptable level in East Africa. Further down the distribution chain, at the household level, approximately 45% of the total number contained total aflatoxin levels higher than the acceptable limit. The on-site detection method correlated well with the established laboratory-based HPLC and ELISA-detection methods for aflatoxin B₁ with the correlation coefficients of 0.94 and 0.98, respectively.

In line with this urging, a primarily Ugandan team of researchers conducted a study of primary schoolchildren’s perspectives on conflict, peace, and peace-building. In the original study, which is briefly reviewed in this manuscript, the children were drawn from 2 Ugandan schools, one located in the northern region and the other in the central region. At each stage of the research process, the team members sought to recognize and resist the reproduction of metacolonialism while move toward more emancipatory practices. In this theoretical article, we explain how we applied a liberation psychological approach to the design, conduct, and analysis of the study. We also show how the findings of the study contribute to our ongoing work in fostering structural changes in one of the schools, its surrounding region, and the nation as a whole.",,Peace and Conflict Journal of Peace Psychology,,,2018-08,2018,24,3,354-363,Closed,Article,"Mayengo, Nathaniel; Namusoke, Jane; Byamugisha, Gastone; Sebukalu, Paul; Kagaari, James; Auma-Okumu, Santo; Baguwemu, Ali; Ntare, Edward Rutondoki; Nakasiita, Kirabo Nkwambe; Atuhairwe, Richard; Goretti, Maria Kaahwa; Okumu Oruma, Gerald Ojok; Thompson, Chalmer E.; Dennis, Barbara","Mayengo, Nathaniel (); Namusoke, Jane (); Byamugisha, Gastone (); Sebukalu, Paul (); Kagaari, James (); Auma-Okumu, Santo (); Baguwemu, Ali (); Ntare, Edward Rutondoki (); Nakasiita, Kirabo Nkwambe (); Atuhairwe, Richard (); Goretti, Maria Kaahwa (); Okumu Oruma, Gerald Ojok (); Thompson, Chalmer E.

This study measured the yield responses of low phosphorus-tolerant common beans to drought stress. A field experiment was conducted under two drought conditions codenamed, non-drought-stress (NDS) and drought-stress (DS). The former was located at Mukono Zonal Agricultural Research and Development Institute (MUZARDI) in Mukono District, characterised by rainfall of more than 400 mm season−1. The latter was situated at Wabinyonyi in Nakasongola District, characterised by less than 300 mm season−1; both in central Uganda. Treatments included the two study conditions (NDS and DS); and four test bean genotypes, AFR703-1, AFR 708, JESCA, and MCM 2001, against a local check, K131. A water deficit of 156 mm season−1 was observed in the DS site causing a drought intensity index (DII) of 40%. That pattern contrasted considerably in the NDS site where the actual rainfall did not significantly (p > 0.05) vary from the required water by the bean plant. Whereas genotypes AFR703-1 and AFR708 out-yielded the local check in NDS by 213 and 681 kg ha−1, respectively; their grain yield harvested was comparable to the control yield in DS. When grown under DS, low P-tolerant beans, especially the AFR703-1 and AFR708, survived drought stress through faster development by reducing the number of days to flower, reach physiological maturity and develop seeds. AFR703-1 and AFR708 sufficiently withstand drought stress, and are therefore recommended for inclusion in cropping systems that are characteristically constrained by the combined soils’ P deficiency and/or drought.",,Agronomy,,,2018-07-30,2018,8,8,132,All OA; Gold,Article,"Namugwanya, Margaret; Tenywa, John Stephen; Otabbong, Erasmus","Namugwanya, Margaret (Department of Agriculture, Kyambogo University, P.

Data on wind speed and minimum and maximum temperatures were evaluated. Wind speed was established to follow a time series that fluctuated around ARIMA (0,1,1) and ARIMA (1,1,1). The optimal ANN model was established at 10 hidden neurons. The performance indices considered all indicated that the ANN wind speed model was superior to the ARIMA model.

AIM: To explore how the Acholi in Northern Uganda manage the aftermath of suicide.
METHODS: We conducted a qualitative study in Gulu district, a post-conflict area in Northern Uganda. We conducted a total of four focus group discussions (FGDs) and 12 key informant (KI) interviews. KI interviews were conducted with community leaders, while the FGDs were conducted with members of the general population. We analysed the data by means of Grounded Theory.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that rituals form a large part in managing suicide among the Acholi. Study communities practised distancing (symbolically and physically) as a way of dealing with the threat of suicide.
CONCLUSION: Distancing was organized into two broad themes: affect regulation and securing future generations.

It is not clear whether the reduction in fertility is due to changing socioeconomic and demographic characteristics over time or stems from the shifts in the reproductive behavior of women. In this paper we examine how fertility rates have changed between 2006 and 2011 and whether these changes have resulted from changing characteristics or from changing reproductive behavior of women.MethodsUsing the 2006 and 2011 Demographic and Health Survey data for Uganda, Multivariate Poisson Decomposition techniques were applied to evaluate observed changes in fertility.ResultsChanging characteristics of women aged 15–49 years significantly contributed to the overall change in fertility from 2006 to 2011. The change observed in older age at first marriage was the major contributor to the changes in fertility. The contribution that can be attributed to changes in reproductive behavior was not significant.ConclusionsThis study finds that the major contribution to the reduction in fertility between 2006 and 2011 was from increased education and delayed marriage among women. Continued improvement in secondary school completion, will lead to older age at first marriage and will continue to be an important factor in Uganda’s declining fertility rates.",AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Measure DHS for granting permission to use the UDHS data and Prof. Daniel A.

Herein, we demonstrate a simple procedure for synthesis of a hybrid of MnO and metallic Co supported on N-doped graphene that exhibits activity and stability as a bifunctional ORR/OER catalyst, with a round trip ORR/OER overvoltage of 0.85 V, which remained constant for at least 70 h when cycling alternately, between oxygen evolution at a current density of 10 mA cm−2 and oxygen reduction at −1 mA cm−2. Insights into the key properties of the catalyst that influence its performance are proposed based on structural characterization by TEM, SEM, Raman spectroscopy, XRD and XPS. Besides MnO and metallic Co as the predominant crystalline species in the Co-Mn hybrid oxide, XPS revealed Mn3O4 and CoO rich surfaces, ascribed to oxidation of MnO and metallic Co due to atmospheric exposure. The synergetic interaction between the Co-Mn hybrid oxides and N-doped graphene, as well as Co-Mn interaction, favor improved ORR, OER and bifunctional ORR/OER performance of the catalyst.","Financial support from National Natural Science Foundation of China (21605067), Liaoning Province Excellent Talent Supporting Program (LJQ2015051), Doctoral Start-up Research Funding of the University of Science and Technology Liaoning (USTL010178) and The National Creation Competition Program (201710146000147), China is acknowledged.

Understanding factors that influence PA behavior in PLWH is a first step in order to devise effective interventions.
Objective: The present review provides a systematic review of the correlates of PA in PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa.
Methods: Electronic databases were searched till April 2016. Keywords included 'physical activity' or 'exercise' or 'sports' and 'AIDS' or 'HIV'.
Results: Ten correlates were identified in 6 studies including 1,015 (329♂) PLWH (mean age range=30.5-40.8years). Lower levels of PA were associated with older age (2/2 studies), a lower number of CD4 cells/µl (1/1), a more severe HIV-stage (1/1), a higher HIV load (1/1), the presence of opportunistic infections (1/1) and a higher BMI (1/1). Fisher's exact tests showed there were more significant correlates in objective tools versus subjective self-report (P=0.03).
Conclusion: The current review shows that participation in PA by PLWH in sub-Saharan Africa is associated with a range of complex factors which should be considered in the daily care of PLWH. This however might require repackaging of the current interventions for PLWH to allow a focus on PA.",,African Health Sciences,,Africa South of the Sahara; Age Factors; Antiviral Agents; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Depression; Exercise; HIV Infections; Health Behavior; Humans; Opportunistic Infections; Pain,2018-06-22,2018,18,2,394-406,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Stubbs, Brendon; Mugisha, James","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium.); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK.); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.; Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.)",,"Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)",3,2,1.19,1.66,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/download/173672/163108,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1105116592,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

In such an effort, cost effective methods in determining optimal replenishment policies are paramount. In this paper, a mathematical model is proposed that optimize inventory replenishment policies of a periodic review inventory system under stochastic demand; with particular focus on malaria drugs in Ugandan pharmacies. Adopting a Markov decision process approach, the states of a Markov chain represent possible states of demand for drugs that treat malaria. Using weekly equal intervals, the decisions of whether or not to replenish additional units of drugs were made using discrete time Markov chains and dynamic programming over a finite period planning horizon. Empirical data was collected from two pharmacies in Uganda. The customer transactions of drugs were taken on a weekly basis; where data collected was analyzed and tested to establish the optimal replenishment policy and inventory costs of drugs. Results from the study indicated the existence of an optimal state-dependent replenishment policy and inventory costs of drugs at the respective pharmacies.",,Brazilian Journal of Operations & Production Management,,,2018-06-01,2018,15,2,302-310,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mubiru, Kizito Paul","Mubiru, Kizito Paul (Kyambogo University)",,"Mubiru, Kizito Paul (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,0.0,https://bjopm.emnuvens.com.br/bjopm/article/download/446/583,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1104440395,1402 Applied Economics; 14 Economics,

The raw HRW was analysed for temperature, pH and total dissolved solids (TDS) and for the presence of the bacterial indicators of faecal pollution – Escherichia coli, faecal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. Results indicated that while the HRW met the required physiochemical drinking water standards, the majority of samples from all types of system showed levels of microbiological contamination indicating that the water was unsafe for drinking without treatment. The use of SODIS to treat the water was investigated using 2Liter PET bottles and was shown to be an effective treatment technology.","The authors have no proprietary, professional, financial, or other personal interest of any nature or kind in any product, service, and/or company that could be construed as influencing the position presented in, or the review of, this work.

Whether RtAF is enjoyed among Ugandan land evictees, is unknown. We therefore explored this among land evictees (rights-holders) in Wakiso and Mpigi districts in rural Central Uganda. We assessed food accessibility and related coping strategies, diet quality and nutritional status of children 6–59 months old, and their caregivers. Effectiveness of the complaint and redress mechanisms in addressing RtAF violations was also explored.MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, quantitative data was collected using a structured questionnaire, with food security and nutritional assessment methods from a total of 215 land evictees including 187 children aged 6–59 months. Qualitative data was collected by reviewing selected national and international documents on the RtAF and key informant interviews with 15 purposively sampled duty-bearers. These included individuals or representatives of the Uganda Human Rights Commission, Resident District Commissioner, Sub-county Chiefs, and local Council leaders.ResultsWe found that 78% of land evictees had insufficient access to food while 69.4% had consumed a less diversified diet. A majority of evictees (85.2%) relied on borrowing food or help from others to cope with food shortages. Of the 187 children assessed, 9.6% were wasted, 18.2% were underweight and 34.2% were stunted. Small, but significant associations, were found between food accessibility, diet quality, food insecurity coping strategies; and the nutritional status of evictees. We observed that administrative, quasi-judicial and judicial mechanisms to provide adequate legal remedies regarding violations of the RtAF among evictees in Uganda are in place, but not effective in doing so.ConclusionLand eviction without adequate legal remedies is a contributor to food insecurity and undernutrition in rural Central Uganda. It is essential that the Government strengthens and enforces the policy and legal environment to ensure adequate and timely compensation of evictees in order to reduce their vulnerability to food insecurity.","AcknowledgementsWe are grateful to NORAD for funding this research through the University of Oslo, Department of Nutrition’s collaborative NOMA project “Develop and deliver a master programme on Nutrition, Human Rights and Governance”.

Despite this, there is a paucity of multinational population data assessing the association between pain and sleep problems, particularly among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Therefore, we investigated the relationship between pain and severe sleep disturbance across 45 LMICs.
METHOD: Community-based data on 240,820 people recruited via the World Health Survey were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression analyses adjusted for multiple confounders were performed to quantify the association between pain and severe sleep problems in the last 30 days. A mediation analysis was conducted to explore potential mediators of the relationship between pain and severe sleep disturbance.
RESULTS: The prevalence of mild, moderate, severe, and extreme levels of pain was 26.0%, 16.2%, 9.1%, and 2.2% respectively, whilst 7.8% of adults had severe sleep problems. Compared to those with no pain, the odds ratio (OR, 95% CI) for severe sleep problems was 3.65 (3.24-4.11), 9.35 (8.19-10.67) and 16.84 (13.91-20.39) for those with moderate, severe and extreme pain levels respectively. A country wide meta-analysis adjusted for age and sex demonstrated a significant increased OR across all 45 countries. Anxiety, depression and stress sensitivity explained 12.9%, 3.6%, and 5.2%, respectively, of the relationship between pain and severe sleep disturbances.
CONCLUSION: Pain and sleep problems are highly co-morbid across LMICs. Future research is required to better understand this relationship. Moreover, future interventions are required to prevent and manage the pain and sleep disturbance comorbidity.","BS is supported by Health Education England and the National Institute for Health Research HEE/NIHR ICA Programme Clinical Lectureship (ICA-CL-2017-03-001).

One of the factors that enhance the risk of hepatotoxicity is underlying diseases such as hepatitis caused by hepatitis B virus (HBV). HIV/HBV coinfected patients stand a greater risk of hepatotoxicity because all ART are toxic and liver cells (hepatocytes) that are responsible for metabolising the toxic ART, support all stages of HIV and HBV viral production. Mathematical models coupled with numerical simulations are used in this study with the aim of investigating the optimal combination of ART in HIV/HBV coinfection.

In the present study, we examined the structural relationships between motivational beliefs, cognitive learning strategies, and academic performance among teacher education students in Uganda. The sample comprised of 1081 students selected from seven universities. Data were collected using several subscales from the modified Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire and were analyzed by structural equation modeling. Cognitive learning strategies fully mediated the relationship between motivational beliefs and academic performance. Motivational beliefs contributed to students’ academic performance mainly through influencing their critical thinking and organizational skills. Therefore, interventions to improve teacher education students’ academic performance should focus not only on boosting their motivation but also on enhancing their use of cognitive learning strategies.","We wish to thank the following people who helped us during data collection at the different universities: Christopher Ebenezer Kiza, Kamonges Wahab Asad, Kibuuka Richard, Matsiko Andrew, David Olema, Okello, Mulangira Frank, and Makulo Anthony.

In interrogating the complex craft of developing inclusive and equal learning environments for children with disabilities, this article draws upon Kershner’s ‘core aspects of teachers’ knowledge and knowing’, and in particular, ‘the school as a site for the development of teaching expertise and the creation of knowledge’. Data is presented from in-depth interviews following videoed lesson observations with experienced teachers in 15 rural, urban and coastal primary schools in four districts in Tanzania. Findings indicate that the teachers’ practice is moving unevenly towards disability equality, and involves processes of inclusions and exclusions. This involves teacher autonomy, agency and reflective practice in the context of material, attitudinal, structural, pedagogic and curricular barriers. The teachers’ expertise has potential to inform national and international policy developments, and so reduce the evident rhetoric-reality gap. In conclusion, it is argued that inclusive education needs to grapple with disability as a social construct, and lessons are drawn for the further fulfilment of the rights of children with disabilities to equal participation in education.",,Social Inclusion,,,2018-03-26,2018,6,1,73-81,All OA; Gold,Article,"Miles, Susie; Westbrook, Jo; Croft, Alison","Miles, Susie (Manchester Institute of Education, University of Manchester, UK); Westbrook, Jo (Centre for International Education, University of Sussex, UK); Croft, Alison (Independent Consultant, UK)",,"Miles, Susie (University of Manchester); Westbrook, Jo (University of Sussex); Croft, Alison ()",2,2,,2.1,https://www.cogitatiopress.com/socialinclusion/article/download/1203/1203,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101805247,1605 Policy and Administration; 1608 Sociology; 16 Studies in Human Society,4 Quality Education; 10 Reduced Inequalities

However, little is known about the correlates of SB in people with depression. Thus, we investigated SB correlates among community-dwelling adults with depression in six low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. The analysis was restricted to those with DSM-IV Depression or receiving depression treatment in the last 12 months. Self-reported time spent sedentary per day was the outcome. High SB was defined as ≥8 hours of SB per day. The correlates (sociodemographic and health-related) of SB were estimated by multivariable linear and logistic regression analyses.
RESULTS: In 2375 individuals with depression (mean age=48.0 years; 60.7% female), the prevalence of high SB was 11.1% (95%CI=8.2%-14.9%), while the mean (±SD) time spent sedentary was 215 (±192) minutes per day. Socio-demographic factors significantly associated with high SB were older age and being unmarried, being male and being unemployed. In other domains, no alcohol consumption, current smoking, mild cognitive impairment, bodily pain, arthritis, stroke, disability, and lower levels of social cohesion, COPD, visual impairment, and poor self-rated health was associated with greater time spent sedentary.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that future interventions seeking to reduce SB among individuals with depression may target at risk groups based on identified sociodemographic correlates while the promotion of social cohesion may have the potential to increase the efficacy of future public health initiatives. From a clinical perspective, bodily pain and somatic co-morbidities need to be taken into account.",None.,Journal of Affective Disorders,,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; China; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Developing Countries; Female; Ghana; Humans; India; Male; Mexico; Middle Aged; Poverty; Prevalence; Russia; Sedentary Behavior; South Africa; Young Adult,2018-03-06,2018,234,,97-104,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Stubbs, Brendon; Mugisha, James; Firth, Joseph; Schuch, Felipe B.; Koyanagi, Ai","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Tervuursevest 101, 3001 Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuvensesteenweg 517, 3070 Kortenberg, Belgium); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, Denmark Hill, London SE5 8AZ, United Kingdom; Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, Box SE5 8AF, United Kingdom; Faculty of Health, Social Care and Education, Anglia Ruskin University, Chelmsford, United Kingdom); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral Mental Hospital, Kampala, Uganda; Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Firth, Joseph (NICM, School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Australia; Division of Psychology and Mental Health, Faculty of Biology, Medicine and Health, University of Manchester, United Kingdom); Schuch, Felipe B.

METHODS: We searched for and reviewed evidence about KT sustainability issues in Uganda, the impacts of options, barriers to implementing these options, and implementation strategies to address such barriers. In instances where the systematic reviews provided limited evidence, these were supplemented with relevant primary studies. Documents such as the government reports and unpublished literature were also included in the search. Key informant interviews and a policy dialogue were conducted, and an expert working group guided the study.
RESULTS: The KT sustainability issues identified were: the absence of a specific unit within the health sector to coordinate and synthesize research; health worker not familiar with KT activities and not often used. Furthermore, Uganda lacks a mechanism to sustain its current national health frameworks or platforms, and does not have a system to ensure the sustained coordination of existing national health KT platforms. The policy options proposed include: (i) the identification of a KT champion; (ii) the establishment of an operational KT framework; (iii) KT capacity building for researchers and research users, as well as policy and decision makers.
CONCLUSIONS: The sustainability of KT will be influenced by the prevailing context and concerns within healthcare both in Uganda and internationally. Furthermore, the availability of resources for KT advocacy, communication, and program design will impact on the sustainability of Uganda's KT activities.",,International Journal of Technology Assessment in Health Care,,Capacity Building; Humans; National Health Programs; Policy; Translational Medical Research; Uganda,2018-03-06,2018,34,1,120-128,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Basaza, Robert; Kinegyere, Alison; Mutatina, Boniface; Sewankambo, Nelson","Basaza, Robert (Makerere University College of Health Sciences; International Health Sciences University, rbasaza@gmail.com); Kinegyere, Alison (Makerere University College of Health Sciences); Mutatina, Boniface (Makerere University College of Health Sciences); Sewankambo, Nelson (Makerere University College of Health Sciences)",,"Basaza, Robert (Makerere University; International Health Sciences University); Kinegyere, Alison (Makerere University); Mutatina, Boniface (Makerere University); Sewankambo, Nelson (Makerere University)",1,1,0.0,0.55,http://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ba77/4330929a2336569a739cb310cc4036c94397.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101356903,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

School practice is a fundamental facet of all teacher preparation that strengthens one’s teaching competencies. Pre-service visual arts teachers in National Teacher Colleges (NTCs) in Uganda are trained as generalist on a two-year diploma program, leading to an award of a diploma in secondary education (DSE). During the entire training pre-service visual arts teachers are exposed to twelve weeks of school practice of which six weeks are done in year one and the remaining six weeks of school practice are done in their final second year. The study followed a quantitative research design where a self constructed questionnaire was administered to fifty pre-service visual arts teachers in one of the NTCs. Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the data collected through the questionnaires. Although the research revealed that pre-service visual arts teachers were satisfied with the general prior preparations for the actual teaching, they needed urgent support in using of a number of assessment strategies; accessing and using tools; selecting and using the most appropriate teaching methods and creating an effective learning environment. It was recommended that NTCs expose pre-service visual arts teachers to the ideal school environment that equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills needed for effective teaching and adaptive skills for any teaching context while still at teacher colleges.",,Academic Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies,,,2018-03-01,2018,7,1,45-55,Closed,Article,"Julius, Ssegantebuka","Julius, Ssegantebuka (Department of Humanities and Language Education Makerere University, 7062, Kampala, Uganda)",,"Julius, Ssegantebuka (Makerere University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101884924,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 1302 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

In this review, we compile archaeological and palaeoenvironmental data from East Africa to document land-cover change, and environmental, subsistence and land-use transitions, over the past 6000 years. Throughout East Africa there have been a series of relatively rapid and high-magnitude environmental shifts characterised by changing hydrological budgets during the mid- to late Holocene. For example, pronounced environmental shifts that manifested as a marked change in the rainfall amount or seasonality and subsequent hydrological budget throughout East Africa occurred around 4000, 800 and 300 radiocarbon years before present (yr BP). The past 6000 years have also seen numerous shifts in human interactions with East African ecologies. From the mid-Holocene, land use has both diversified and increased exponentially, this has been associated with the arrival of new subsistence systems, crops, migrants and technologies, all giving rise to a sequence of significant phases of land-cover change. The first large-scale human influences began to occur around 4000 yr BP, associated with the introduction of domesticated livestock and the expansion of pastoral communities. The first widespread and intensive forest clearances were associated with the arrival of iron-using early farming communities around 2500 yr BP, particularly in productive and easily-cleared mid-altitudinal areas. Extensive and pervasive land-cover change has been associated with population growth, immigration and movement of people. The expansion of trading routes between the interior and the coast, starting around 1300 years ago and intensifying in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries CE, was one such process. These caravan routes possibly acted as conduits for spreading New World crops such as maize (Zea mays), tobacco (Nicotiana spp.) and tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum), although the processes and timings of their introductions remains poorly documented. The introduction of southeast Asian domesticates, especially banana (Musa spp.), rice (Oryza spp.), taro (Colocasia esculenta), and chicken (Gallus gallus), via transoceanic biological transfers around and across the Indian Ocean, from at least around 1300 yr BP, and potentially significantly earlier, also had profound social and ecological consequences across parts of the region. Through an interdisciplinary synthesis of information and metadatasets, we explore the different drivers and directions of changes in land-cover, and the associated environmental histories and interactions with various cultures, technologies, and subsistence strategies through time and across space in East Africa. This review suggests topics for targeted future research that focus on areas and/or time periods where our understanding of the interactions between people, the environment and land-cover change are most contentious and/or poorly resolved. The review also offers a perspective on how knowledge of regional land-use change can be used to inform and provide perspectives on contemporary issues such as climate and ecosystem change models, conservation strategies, and the achievement of nature-based solutions for development purposes.","Numerous people have offered support and comment on the research at various stages of its development; without these contributions, this work would not have been possible.

METHODS: Follow-up study of a cluster-randomised controlled trial conducted between October 2013 and January 2015. Data were available from 399 mother/child pairs (203 in the intervention and 198 in the control group) of the original trial (78%) when the children were 36 months old. Oral health behaviour was evaluated using questionnaires. Photographs of the maxillary anterior teeth were examined for unmistakably carious lesions, and 115 water samples from the study area were analysed for fluoride concentration.
RESULTS: The frequency of cleaning of the child's teeth at 36 months was about twice as high in the intervention as in the control group (84.3% vs. 46.6%; P = 0.0001). Cavitated carious lesions occurred more frequently in the control than the intervention group (27.8% vs. 18.2%; P = 0.04). Extraction of 'false teeth' (ebiino), a painful and crude traditional operation, was profoundly reduced in the intervention group (8.9% vs. 24.7%; P = 0.001). There was no evidence of association between the occurrence of caries and child growth.
CONCLUSIONS: The education intervention improved oral hygiene practices and reduced the development and progression of caries and extraction of ebiino. Early childhood caries was not clearly associated with child growth.",We are grateful to the Throne Holst Foundation and University of Oslo for the funding of the study.

1,pub.1099735234,10.1109/jlt.2017.2782886,,,Volterra Series Based Linearity Analysis of a Phase-Modulated Microwave Photonic Link,"An analytical technique based on Volterra series for systematically computing distortion in analog microwave photonic (MWP) links is presented in this paper. In the analysis, we express both modulator and photodetector responses in the MWP link as Taylor series expansions, which are then nested to give rise to Volterra series for systems with memory. Closed-form expressions of the link photocurrent and optical power based on the nth-order Volterra kernels are derived from the functional Taylor series of the MWP link. These expressions are applicable in both direct detection and phase-modulated conditions hitherto referred to as memoryless case and with memory, respectively. The synthesized Volterra kernels are primarily used to determine key figures of merit such as nth-order harmonic distortion, third-order intermodulation distortion (IMDn), and third-order intercept point (OIPn) for an arbitrary MWP link. We apply the technique to a photonic link having a ring-assisted Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RAMZI) filter and compare its OIP3 performance with that of an MZI discriminator. Within a bandwidth of 20 GHz, it is shown that RAMZI has 10-dB better OIP3 performance than MZI. We also illustrate that OIP3 and IMD measurements done using three-tone tests would result in more accurate predictions of MWP link parameters than standard two-tone tests.",,Journal of Lightwave Technology,,,2018-02-27,2018,36,9,1537-1551,Closed,Article,"Serunjogi, Solomon Micheal; Sanduleanu, Mihai Adrian; Rasras, Mahmoud S.","Serunjogi, Solomon Micheal (Dept. of Electr.

The in vitro antibacterial activity of the stem, root bark, and leaf extracts of three selected plants on which yellow baboons feed in an unusual manner in Mikumi National Park, Tanzania, was evaluated. Crude plant extracts were tested against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria of medical and veterinary importance employing a modified agar well diffusion method and Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) technique. The lowest MIC value for Gram positive strains was 0.31 mg/ml demonstrated by Cassia abbreviata ssp. abbreviata against Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923). The highest susceptibility to the ethanol plant extracts was exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus, examples of microbes that affect both human and nonhuman primates. These findings demonstrate that the plant extracts from Sterculia africana , Acacia sieberiana, and Cassia abbreviata ssp. abbreviata have antibacterial activity and may be used as feed for their prophylactic benefits. Remarkably, the lowest MIC of 0.16 mg/ml was only 16-fold weaker than Gentamicin, a standard drug.","The authors acknowledge INTRA-ACP mobility scholarship and RISE-AFNNET for partially funding this research and the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Sokoine University of Agriculture, for facilitating this study.

Despite the large number of refugees entering Europe, especially following the outbreak of the conflict in Syria, there has been little academic research on the refugee migration-service industries nexus. The minimal attention on the interface between refugee migration and service industries is surprising, considering the impacts of the refugee movement on service sectors and the opportunities for refugee migrants within several service industries. In acknowledging this gap, this paper considers the development of the research on refugee migration within service industries and suggests that future studies distinguish between the terms ‘refugee’ and ‘migrant’, embrace longitudinal studies and consider a macro approach in their investigation to transcend research focus from specific service aspects to service industries as a whole.

Though these health disparities occur given a variety of factors, novel, technology-based interventions are being developed to increase physical activity, with Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) serving as a useful framework for guiding such interventions. Purpose: This investigation sought to evaluate 2 technology-based interventions on physical activity motivation and psychosocial variables among young African American women. Methods: Forty-nine female African American college students aged 18–24 used an UpBand accelerometer and app or a diet tracker app for 6 weeks. Posttesting occurred at the conclusion of the intervention and 2 months postintervention. Results: Perceived family support for exercise decreased in both groups, F(2, 94) = 9.90, P < .001, partial η2 = 0.17. Following an initial decrease in exercise self-efficacy scores from pre- to posttest, an increase in exercise self-efficacy was evidenced from posttest to the 2-month follow-up for both groups, F(1, 47) = 10.90, P = .002, partial η2 = 0.188. Discussion: Although technology-based physical activity apps include social constructs, this study did not find strong support for promoting the psychosocial variables among participants. The use of fitness-promoting technology may facilitate exercise self-efficacy in minority female college students.

Fifty Ugandan patients completed the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-3 (BREQ-3) to assess exercise motives, the Patient-centred Assessment and Counselling for Exercise (PACE) to determine stage of change and the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test. The relationship between motives for physical activity and stage of change was investigated using ANOVA with post-hoc Scheffe tests. Multivariate analyses found significantly higher levels of introjected, identified and integrated motivation in the action and maintenance stage versus the pre-action stage. There were no differences in intrinsic motivation between the stages of change. Our results suggest that in order to adopt and maintain an active lifestyle the most important source of motivation comes from the benefits that may be obtained rather than from the inherent pleasure or challenge associated with it.

The results indicated that, the Lake George wetlands supplied tangible benefits to the fishing communities, amounting to 0.44% only of all the annual economic benefits of Lake George wetlands in 2004. The intangible but nonetheless important services to the peoples’ livelihoods in the fishing villages accounted for about 99.56% during the same period. Management accounted for at least 3% while wildlife related damage costs (borne by the villages) were the highest at 53.5%. The net social cost benefit of conserving the Lake George wetlands in 2004 was USD 56.4 million or UGS 101.2 billion while the NPV (R = 10.64; t = 25) was USD 491 million. Whereas protection of the Lake George wetlands still remains a viable option, the tangible benefits from the wetlands still remain to be fully realized; the tangible benefits of wetlands are minimal and the local peoples’ interest in protecting the wetland is therefore low. It is recommended that in Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), 1) tangible benefits as further motivation and creation of local interest in the wetland should be considered, 2) the linkages between use values and ecosystem functions of the wetland must be stressed, and 3) ways of reducing wildlife related damage to the fishing village community lives and property should be discovered.

Physiotherapists could have a central role in reducing the burden and facilitating recovery within the multidisciplinary care of people with mental health problems. The aim of this systematic review was to explore the role of physiotherapists within the current mental health policies of SSA countries and to explore the current research evidence for physiotherapy to improve functional outcomes in people with mental health problems in SSA.MethodsThe Mental Health Atlas and MiNDbank of the World Health Organization were screened for the role of physiotherapy in mental health plans. Next, we systematically searched PubMed from inception until August 1st, 2017 for relevant studies on physiotherapy interventions in people with mental health problems in SSA. The following search strategy was used: “physiotherapy” OR “physical therapy” OR “rehabilitation” AND “mental” OR “depression” OR “psychosis” OR “schizophrenia” OR “bipolar” AND the name of the country.ResultsThe current systematic review shows that in 22 screened plans only 2 made reference to the importance of considering physiotherapy within the multidisciplinary treatment. The current evidence (N studies = 3; n participants = 94) shows that aerobic exercise might reduce depression and improve psychological quality of life, self-esteem, body image and emotional stress in people with HIV having mental health problems. In people with depression moderate to high but not light intensity aerobic exercise results in significantly less depressive symptoms (N = 1, n = 30). Finally, there is evidence for reduction in post-traumatic stress symptoms (avoidance and arousal), anxiety and depression following body awareness related exercises (N = 1, n = 26).ConclusionsOur review demonstrated that physiotherapy is still largely neglected in the mental health care systems of SSA.

We explore the modes of food acquisition, dietary diversity, caloric and protein intake, and qualitative food insecurity measures for different categories of respondents. We conduct a cross-sectional analysis comparing old clients to newly registered first time borrowers. Next, we compare first time borrowers and non-borrowers using a panel design. While the cross-sectional analysis allows the comparison of women that similarly self-selected into borrowing, the panel analysis complements by providing insights into changes of food security parameters. In both cases, we use Kernel matching, or difference-in-difference with Kernel matching, to control for potential bias in observables, and perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to unobservables using Rosenbaum bounds as well as an individual fixed effects panel analysis. Results show a decline in food security following the uptake of microcredit. In particular, the analysis reveals robustly lower dietary diversity among long-time borrowers than new borrowers, and larger reductions in dietary diversity scores among new borrowers, after 1 year, compared to controls. The reduction in dietary diversity was traced to a reduction in animal-source food, fruit and sugar intake. We find indicative evidence that this is partly explained by a shift from own production to reliance on food purchase by households. Other household members relegating the burden of food provision to women after borrowing may also help explain the observed result.",,Journal of African Economies,,,2018-01-17,2018,27,4,457-482,Closed,Article,"Namayengo, Faith M; Antonides, Gerrit; Cecchi, Francesco","Namayengo, Faith M (Wageningen University, Urban Economics Group, Hollandseweg 1, Wageningen KN, The Netherlands; Kyambogo University, P.O.

Previous researches revealed that visitor perception of service quality influences service delivery and ultimate satisfaction. In Senegal, and West Africa at large, hotels embarking on putting in place relevant service quality systems are aiming to meet the levels of satisfaction of their visitors. This supports gaining a competitive advantage and attracting international visitors, including those from new markets such as China. The current study reveals the five major dimensions that influence Chinese visitors’ perceptions of service quality of hotels in Senegal.

The country has now approved 17 field experiments for GE plants, which were first established in 2006 with the planting of a banana confined field trial that evaluated performance of plants modified to express resistance to black sigatoka disease. Researchers leading the GE experiments have indicated that some of these GE plants are ready for environmental release that is moving beyond confined field testing toward commercialization. The government of Uganda, over the past two decades, has supported processes to put in place an effective national biosafety framework including establishment of a supportive policy environment; creation of a clear institutional framework for handling applications and issuance of permits; building critical capacity for risk analysis; and providing options for public engagement during decision-making. Uganda is ready to make a biosafety decision regarding environmental release of GE plants based on the level of capacity built, progress with priority GE crop research in the country, and the advancement in biosafety systems. Enactment of a national biosafety law that provides for a coordinated framework for implementation by the relevant regulatory agencies will strengthen the system further. In addition, product developers need to submit applications for biosafety approval for environmental release of GE crops so that mechanisms are tested and improved through practice.",We acknowledge the contribution of GE crop research partners and biosafety development agencies in providing information related to status of biotechnology research and capacity for regulation.

OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were; (i) to compare the level of institutionalization of ART programs in health facilities in Uganda and (ii) to explore reasons for variations in the degree of program institutionalization.
METHODS: In Phase One, we utilized Level of Institutionalization Scales developed by Goodman (1993) to measure the degree of institutionalization of ART interventions in 195 health facilities across Uganda. The 45-item questionnaire measured institutionalization based on four sub-systems (production, maintenance, supportive, managerial) theorized to make up an organization assessed against two levels of institutionalization; routines (lowest) niche saturation (highest). In Phase Two, four health facilities were purposively selected (2 with the highest and 2 with the lowest institutionalization scores) for a multiple case-study involving semi-structured interviews with ART clinic managers(n = 32), on-site observations and document review.
RESULTS: The two highest scoring health facilities had a longer HIV intervention implementation history of between 8 and 11 years. The highest scoring cases associated intervention institutionalization with sustained workforce trainings in ART management, the retention of ART-trained personnel and generating in-house ART manuals. The turnover of ART-proficient staff was identified as a barrier to intervention institutionalization in the lowest-ranked cases. Significant differences in organizational contexts were identified. The two highest-ranked health facilities were well-established, higher-tier hospitals while the lowest scoring health facilities were lower-level health facilities.
CONCLUSIONS: The level of institutionalization of ART interventions appeared to be differentiated by level of care in the Ugandan health system. Interventions aimed at strengthening program institutionalization in lower-level health centers at the level of human resources for health could enhance ART scale-up sustainability.",The authors gratefully acknowledge the valuable suggestions offered by an anonymous reviewer in the Abstract Mentor Program of The International AIDS Society (IAS 2017).

The major and some trace elements (Si, Ti, Al, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Na, K, Cr, Ni, Ba, Sr, La, Ce, Nd, Nb) has been analyzed in olivine, clinopyroxene, phlogopite, Cr-spinel, titanomagnetite, perovskite and carbonates of xenoliths and their host lavas. Bunyaruguru is one of three (Katwe-Kikorongo, Fort Portal and Bunyaruguru) volcanic fields included in the Toro-Ankole province located on the North end of the West Branch of the East African Rift. The xenoliths from three craters within the Bunyaruguru volcanic field revealed the different character of metasomatic alteration, reflecting the heterogeneity of the mantle on the kilometer scale. The most unusual finding was composite glimmerite-wehrlite xenolith from the crater Kazimiro, which contains the fresh primary high-Mg olivine with inclusions of Cr-spinel that had not been previously identified in this area. The different composition of phenocryst and xenolith minerals indicates that the studied xenoliths are not сumulus of enclosing magma, but the composition of xenoliths characterizes the lithology of the upper mantle of the area. The carbonate melt inclusions in olivine Fo90 demonstrate the existence of primary carbonatitic magmas in Bunyaruguru upper mantle. The results of texture and chemical investigation of the xenolith minerals indicate the time sequence of metasomatic alteration of Bunyaruguru upper mantle: MARID metasomatism at the first stage followed by carbonate metasomatism. The abundances of REE in perovskites from kamafugite are 2–4 times higher than similar values for xenolith. Therefore the kamafugite magma was been generated from a more enriched mantle source than the source of the xenoliths. The evaluation of P-T conditions formation of clinopyroxene xenolith revealed the range of pressure 20–65kbar and the temperatures range 830–1040°C. The pressure of clinopyroxene phenocryst crystallization differs from pressure of formation the xenoliths clinopyroxene: it may be higher or lower of it. The results of our investigation have shown that olivine can play a noticeable role in the lithology of the upper mantle Bunyaruguru volcanic field.",,Lithos,,,2018-01,2018,296,,17-36,Closed,Article,"Muravyeva, N.S.; Senin, V.G.","Muravyeva, N.S.

Finding sustainable, active, inexpensive, and stable electrocatalysts to replace Pt-based materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a significant challenge. Here we report the use of functionalized lignin biomass as both carbon and dopant source for the direct synthesis of N and S dual-doped carbon sheet networks with abundant mesopores and high surface area. The resulting N and S-doped porous carbon exhibits good activity, long-term durability, and high selectivity for metal-free oxygen reduction electrocatalysis, approaching the performance of 20 wt% Pt/C, the state of the art ORR catalyst. Our method using natural biological resources thus offers a promising way to produce very promising noble metal-free ORR catalysts with potential application in alkaline fuel cells and metal–air batteries.","This work was supported by the State Key Laboratory of Organic–Inorganic Composites (No. oic-201503005); the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2017YFB0306800); the 111 project (B13005); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (No. buctrc201525); Beijing National Laboratory for Molecular Sciences (BNLMS20160133); State Key Laboratory of Separation Membranes and Membrane Processes (Tianjin Polytechnic University, No. M2-201704).

In this study, the efficacy of malakwang leaf extract as a potential regulator of serum lipids, urea and creatinine was investigated in hyperlipidemic rats. Forty two albino rats were arranged randomly into seven groups of six and fed with diets. The groups were categorised into four experimental and three control groups. The rats in the experimental groups were fed on high fat diets containing different amounts of leaf extract from red and white malakwang variants. Control groups were fed on diets devoid of malakwang: a basic standard rat diet; high fat diet; and high fat with atorvastatin. The diets were administered daily and rat weight determined. On the last day, blood was drawn from the rats and the serum analysed for lipids, creatinine and urea using spectrophotometric techniques. Statistical analysis was used to estimate mean differences in weight and concentration of the biochemical parameters between experimental and control groups. Results indicated a decrease in weight gained up to the fourth week in rats fed on the high fat diet with malakwang leaf extract. There was a significant difference in the levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (p < 0.05), with lower levels in rats fed on 200 mg/kg red and 400 mg/kg white malakwang leaf extract. No significant change was noted in total cholesterol and triglycerides. Whereas there was a higher level of serum creatinine with the two malakwang variants (p < 0.05), serum urea levels were significantly lower. Leaf extracts of both red and white malakwang (Hibiscus) exhibited capacity to reduce low density lipoprotein cholesterol, maintained serum urea but not creatinine.

The problem is not an absence of laws providing for the taxation of wealthy individuals (commonly referred to as High Net Worth Individuals (HNWIs)). Rather, these laws are rarely implemented.

Based on the analysis of 150 autobiographies of teachers from a range of regions in the developing world including Central Asia, South Asia, East Africa and the Middle East, the author celebrates individual teachers’ voices and explores their narratives. What can these narratives tell us about ‘becoming’ and 'being’ a teacher, and the process of teacher development? What is different about ‘becoming’ and ‘being’ a teacher in the developing world? By analysing the distinct narratives, the author explores these central questions and discusses the implications for further teacher development and education in these regions. In doing so, she transforms teachers’ embodied knowledge into public knowledge, shining a light onto the challenges they face in the Global South and exploring how research can be advanced in the future.

It examines the implications of the related publicity for the perception of Greece and the expected reaction of inbound tourists; the way refugees are regarded from a security and cultural aspect; the interaction between refugees and host communities; and the decisions made by the Greek tourism accommodation sector to face the crisis. Using fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis the paper employs a nationwide survey of 811 tourism accommodation managers. The results reveal three configurations explaining the decisions of respondents characterised by refugee-centric orientation; the emphasis on the visitors-locals nexus; and the host communities' behavioural impact on tourism. The paper also compares asymmetric with symmetric analysis highlighting the suitability of the former when dealing with complexity.

We investigated PA correlates among community-dwelling adults aged ≥ 65 years with anxiety symptoms in six low- and middle-income countries.
METHODS: Cross-sectional data from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health were analyzed. PA level was assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. 980 participants with anxiety (mean age 73.3 years; 62.4% females) were grouped into those who do and do not (low PA) meet the 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous PA per week recommendation. Associations between PA and the correlates were examined using multivariable logistic regressions.
RESULTS: The prevalence of low PA was 44.9% (95% CI = 39.2-50.7%). Older age, male gender, less consumption of alcohol, mild cognitive impairment, pain, a wide range of somatic co-morbidities, slow gait, weak grip strength, poor self-rated health, and lower levels of social cohesion were identified as significant positive correlates of low PA.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data illustrate that a number of sociodemographic and health factors are associated with PA levels among older people with symptoms of anxiety. The promotion of social cohesion may increase the efficacy of public health initiatives, while from a clinical perspective, somatic co-morbidities, cognitive impairment, pain, muscle strength, and slow gait need to be considered.","A.

Keberadaannya tidak jauh di sekitar kita, relatif murah dan mudah mendapatkannya. Di beberapa negara luar seperti Uganda, Algeria, India dan lain-lain memanfaatkan serbuk gergaji ini untuk berbagai keperluan diantaranya sebagai bahan campuran batu-bata, pembentuk polimer selulosa nitrat, dan bahan adsorben polutan organik phenol. Penelitian sebelumnya memanfaatkan serbuk gergaji sebagai bahan tambahan campuran batu-bata (kaolin, tanah liat, serbuk gergaji) dengan rasio 90:70:40. Metode: Penelitian ini merupakan eksperimen semu. Selanjutnya penulis tertarik untuk mengembangkan penelitian tersebut, untuk serbuk gergaji dibuat variasi berat bahannya, sementara yang lainnya tetap. Ukuran batu-bata dirancang berukuran 10,00 x 5,00 x 2,00 cm. Untuk mengetahui kualitas batu-bata yang dihasilkan, penulis melakukan analisis kualitas terhadap batu-bata yang dihasilkan dengan berbagai variasi berat tersebut. Kualitas yang diuji baru pada tahapan daya serap air dan kandungan garam. Selain uji kualitas batu-bata juga dilakukan analisis valuasi ekonominya. Penelitian ini dilakukan pada skala laboratorium dengan harapan dapat dijadikan bahan acuan apabila akan diaplikasikan di lapangan. Hasil: Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa variasi berat serbuk gergaji antara rasio 20:70:90 dan 40:70:90 menunjukkan ada perbedaan peringkat rata-rata yang bermakna dalam hal daya serap batu-bata terhadap air begitu juga antara rasio 20:70:90 dan 60:70:90. Semua campuran batu-bata berdaya serap > 20%, belum memenuhi standar kualitas berdasarkan SNI 15-2094-2000, namun semua campuran batu-bata mempunyai kadar garam  (NaCl) < 50%, ini artinya sudah memenuhi standar kualitas berdasarkan SNI 15-2094-2000. Simpulan: Waktu pembakaran batu-bata dengan bahan tambahan serbuk gergaji lebih efisien 0,42 kalidibandingkan tanpa serbuk gergaji sehingga biaya lebih hemat.   Abstract  Title: Quality Analysis Brick Sourced Sawdust in a Variety of Weight Background: Sawdust as organic waste has not been widely used. Its presence close to us, cheap and easy to obtain. In others countries such as Uganda, Algeria, India and others, utilize sawdust for various purposes, such as mixed materials, forming polymers cellullose nitrate, and phenol pollutant adsorbent. Previous research utilizes sawdust as mixture of brick with a ratio of 90:70:40: (kaolin, clay,sawdust). Method: This was a quasi experiment design.Furthermore, authors interested in developing such research, sawdust made weight variation while others remain. Size bricks are designed measuring 10.00 x 5.00 x 2.00 cm. To determine the quality of bricks produced, the authors analyze the quality of the bricks produced with a variety of weight of the sawdust. The quality of the tested new stage of absorption of water and salt content. In addition to testing the quality of bricks also performed a valuation analysis of its economy. This research was carried out on a laboratory scale with the hope can be used as a reference if it will be applied in the field. Result: The results showed that weight variation sawdust between 20:70:90 and 40:70:90 ratio showed no difference in the average rating is meaningful in terms of absorption bricks to water as well as the ratio of 20:70:90 and 60 : 70: 90. All blends brick absorbent> 20%, yet meet the standards of quality based on SNI 15-2094-2000, but all of a mixture of brick had higher levels of salt (NaCl) <50%, this means that it meets quality standards based on SNI 15-2094 -2000.

One of those, subcluster PnecC, was recognized as a cryptic species complex. Here we test by comparative genome analyses whether subcluster PnecD, currently solely represented by the species Polynucleobactercosmopolitanus, also represents such a cryptic species complex. The genome sequences of the two P. cosmopolitanus strains, MWH-MoIso2T and MWH-VicM1, were determined. The latter strain was also characterized in the previous description of P. cosmopolitanus. These two strains originate from a temperate lake located in Austria and from the large tropical Lake Victoria located in East Africa, respectively. Strains MWH-MoIso2T and MWH-VicM1 possess quite small genomes of 1.78 and 1.63 Mbp, respectively, and share similar G+C values of 44.1 and 43.1 mol%, respectively. Both strains encode only a single copy of the ribosomal operon, and their 16S rRNA genes differ only in four positions, equalling a sequence similarity of 99.74 %. Both genomes possess characteristics indicating evolutionary genome streamlining, such as high coding densities of 93.9 and 94.6 % of bases, respectively. Average nucleotide identity (ANI) comparisons of the genomes of the two strains resulted in a value of 78.4 %, suggesting that each of the strains represents a separate species. Our investigation suggests that PnecD represents an additional cryptic species complex within the genus Polynucleobacter that was not resolved by 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses. We propose reclassification of strain MWH-VicM1 as Polynucleobacter victoriensis sp. nov., with type strain MWH-VicM1T(=DSM 21486T=JCM 32005T).",,International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology,,"Africa, Eastern; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Burkholderiaceae; DNA, Bacterial; Lakes; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2017-10-25,2017,67,12,5087-5093,All OA; Gold,Article,"Hahn, Martin W; Schmidt, Johanna; Asiyo, Grace Ssanyu; Kyrpides, Nikos C; Woyke, Tanja; Whitman, William B","Hahn, Martin W (Research Department for Limnology, University of Innsbruck, Mondseestrasse 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria.); Schmidt, Johanna (Research Department for Limnology, University of Innsbruck, Mondseestrasse 9, A-5310 Mondsee, Austria.); Asiyo, Grace Ssanyu (Department of Biological Sciences, Kyambogo University, P.O Box 1, Kyambogo, Uganda.); Kyrpides, Nikos C (DOE Joint Genome Institute, 2800 Mitchell Drive, Walnut Creek, CA 94598-1698, USA.); Woyke, Tanja (DOE Joint Genome Institute, 2800 Mitchell Drive, Walnut Creek, CA 94598-1698, USA.); Whitman, William B (Department of Microbiology, University of Georgia, 527 Biological Sciences Building, Athens, GA, USA.)",,"Hahn, Martin W (University of Innsbruck); Schmidt, Johanna (University of Innsbruck); Asiyo, Grace Ssanyu (Kyambogo University); Kyrpides, Nikos C (Joint Genome Institute); Woyke, Tanja (Joint Genome Institute); Whitman, William B (University of Georgia)",5,2,0.58,0.95,https://doi.org/10.1099/ijsem.0.002421,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092358884,0604 Genetics; 06 Biological Sciences,

Thus, we investigated what factors influence PA participation among 915 community-dwelling older adults (aged ≥65 years) with depression in 6 low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHODS: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from the World Health Organization's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health. The sample was restricted to those with DSM-IV depression or receiving depression treatment in the last 12 months. PA was assessed by the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants were dichotomized into low (ie, not meeting 150 minutes of moderate PA per week) and moderate-to-high physically active groups. Associations between PA and a range of correlates were examined using multivariable logistic regressions.
RESULTS: The prevalence of low PA was 40.4% (95%CI = 34.8%-46.1%). After adjusting for age, sex, and country, larger household size and unemployment were significant sociodemographic correlates of low PA. Former smoking (vs never), anxiety, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), lower body mass index, bodily pain, asthma, chronic back pain, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hearing problems, stroke, slow gait, poor self-rated health, higher levels of disability, and lower levels of social cohesion were identified as significant negative correlates of PA.
CONCLUSIONS: The current data provide guidance for future interventions across LMICs to assist older people with depression engage in regular PA. The promotion of social cohesion may increase the efficacy of future public health initiatives, while from a clinical perspective, somatic co-morbidities, MCI, pain, and slow gait need to be considered.",None.,International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depressive Disorder; Developing Countries; Exercise; Family Characteristics; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Independent Living; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sedentary Behavior; Social Behavior; Unemployment",2017-10-10,2017,33,2,e314-e322,Closed,Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Stubbs, Brendon; Veronese, Nicola; Mugisha, James; Swinnen, Nathalie; Koyanagi, Ai","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuven‐Kortenberg, Belgium); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology, and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK); Veronese, Nicola (National Research Council, Neuroscience Institute, Aging Branch, Padova, Italy); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda; Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); Swinnen, Nathalie (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuven‐Kortenberg, Belgium); Koyanagi, Ai (Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain; Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Salud Mental, CIBERSAM, Madrid, Spain)",,"Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); Veronese, Nicola (Neuroscience Institute); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University); Swinnen, Nathalie (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Koyanagi, Ai (University of Barcelona; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Salud Mental)",10,9,1.62,4.38,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1092133374,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

Sedentary behavior and low physical activity are independent yet modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease and premature mortality in these people. A comprehensive meta-analysis exploring these risk factors is lacking in this vulnerable population. We conducted a meta-analysis investigating sedentary behavior and physical activity levels and their correlates in people with severe mental illness. Major electronic databases were searched from inception up to April 2017 for articles measuring sedentary behavior and/or physical activity with a self-report questionnaire or an objective measure (e.g., accelerometer). Random effects meta-analyses and meta-regression analyses were conducted. Sixty-nine studies were included (N=35,682; 39.5% male; mean age 43.0 years). People with severe mental illness spent on average 476.0 min per day (95% CI: 407.3-545.4) being sedentary during waking hours, and were significantly more sedentary than age- and gender-matched healthy controls (p=0.003). Their mean amount of moderate or vigorous physical activity was 38.4 min per day (95% CI: 32.0-44.8), being significantly lower than that of healthy controls (p=0.002 for moderate activity, p<0.001 for vigorous activity). People with severe mental illness were significantly less likely than matched healthy controls to meet physical activity guidelines (odds ratio = 1.5; 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p<0.001, I2 =95.8). Lower physical activity levels and non-compliance with physical activity guidelines were associated with male gender, being single, unemployment, fewer years of education, higher body mass index, longer illness duration, antidepressant and antipsychotic medication use, lower cardiorespiratory fitness and a diagnosis of schizophrenia. People with bipolar disorder were the most physically active, yet spent most time being sedentary. Geographical differences were detected, and inpatients were more active than outpatients and those living in the community. Given the established health benefits of physical activity and its low levels in people with severe mental illness, future interventions specifically targeting the prevention of physical inactivity and sedentary behavior are warranted in this population.","B.

The effect of an education intervention including nutrition, stimulation, sanitation, and hygiene on child growth and cognitive/language/motor development, delivered to impoverished mothers in Uganda, was assessed. In a community-based, open cluster-randomized trial, 511 mother/children dyads aged 6-8 months were enrolled to an intervention (n = 263) or control (n = 248) group. The primary outcome was change in length-for-age z-score at age 20-24 months. Secondary outcomes included anthropometry and scores on the 2 developmental scales: Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-III and the Ages and Stages Questionnaire. There was no evidence of a difference in mean length-for-age z-score at 20-24 months between the 2 study groups: 0.10, 95% CI [-0.17, 0.36], p = .49.

This study aimed at understanding the experiences of caregivers and their survival strategies.MethodsA total of 18 caregivers (3 males and 15 females) were interviewed using a semi-structured interview guide, and thematic analysis was used to analyse the data.ResultsAnalysis suggests that the caregivers are burdened with insecure provisions for food and difficulties in accessing health care. They however survived these strains through managing their relationships, sharing burden with care-recipients, social networks and instrumental spirituality. These findings are discussed under two major themes: 1). Labour of caregiving and 2). Survivalism.ConclusionsHome-based care presents huge opportunities for community response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in African settings. It is however burdensome and thus should not be left for families alone to shoulder. There is therefore an urgent need for protecting home-based care for HIV children in Uganda. Implications for improving and strengthening social interventions in home-based care of HIV/AIDS in the Ugandan context are addressed.","AcknowledgementsWe acknowledge the interviewer for this study Winifred Nalukenge.

The present study aimed to (1) explore if exercise self-efficacy differed between stages of behavior change in Ugandan outpatients with psychosis, and (2) assess sociodemographic, clinical and motivational correlates of exercise self-efficacy. In total, 48 patients (24 women) completed the Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES), the Patient-centered Assessment and Counseling for Exercise questionnaire, the Brief Symptoms Inventory-18 (BSI-18), and questions pertaining to intrinsic motivation in the Behavioral Regulation in Exercise Questionnaire-2. Additionally, participants were asked about their exercise behavior in the past 7 days and screened for cardio-metabolic risk factors. Higher ESES-scores were observed in those in the maintenance (n = 17) versus those in the pre-action stage (n = 17) of behavior change. Higher ESES-scores were also significantly associated with lower BSI-18 somatization and higher intrinsic motivation scores. Our data indicated that health care professionals should assist patients with psychosis in interpreting physiological states during exercise. Future research should explore whether bolstering such sources of information might directly or indirectly effect exercise self-efficacy.",,Psychiatry Research,,Adult; Counseling; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Motivation; Psychotic Disorders; Risk Factors; Self Efficacy; Sex Factors; Somatoform Disorders; Statistics as Topic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uganda,2017-09-08,2017,262,,359-362,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Gorczynski, Paul; De Hert, Marc; Probst, Michel; Naisiga, Annetie; Basangwa, David; Mugisha, James","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium; University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium); Gorczynski, Paul (University of Portsmouth, Department of Sport and Exercise Science, Portsmouth, UK); De Hert, Marc (University Psychiatric Centre KU Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium); Probst, Michel (KU Leuven Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium); Naisiga, Annetie (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); Basangwa, David (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda; Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Gorczynski, Paul (University of Portsmouth); De Hert, Marc (KU Leuven); Probst, Michel (KU Leuven); Naisiga, Annetie (); Basangwa, David (); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)",3,2,0.23,1.14,https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/7759013/Exercise_self_efficacy_correlates.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091501561,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

In this paper a novel advanced continuum damage mechanics (ACDM) method is proposed, which can predict the crack propagation and fracture behavior correctly for the structures. The material property degradation method, which is usually used when simulating the structures within the framework of CDM, is advanced based on considering the influence of crack direction. The maximum tensile stress criterion is used to predict the damage initiation and crack propagation direction and the advanced CDM used to predict the damage evolution process in meso-level under the quasi-static load. It can directly evaluate the propagation process of the discrete crack and the fracture strength for structures using the continuum model as well as not using discontinuum model. The algorithm for the application of our advanced CDM theory in the numerical simulation based on finite element method (FEM) is presented. ACDM model is not only a simple and useful model which can easily be used in FEM framework but also a phenomenological model based on the concept of crack propagation. The simulation results by our ACDM are compared with the experiment results and the ones and from cohesive zone method and extended finite element method for good agreements to be achieved.","This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China [grant numbers 11272096, 11472086, 11532013].",International Journal of Mechanical Sciences,,,2017-09,2017,130,,487-496,Closed,Article,"Yun, Kumchol; Wang, Zhenqing; Ronald, Sakaya; Pak, Yongchol","Yun, Kumchol (College of Aerospace and Civil Engineering, Harbin Engineering University, Harbin 150001, PR China; Faculty of Mechanics, Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang 950003, D.P.R.

In a companion editorial, we describe a range of capacity-building activities that are being implemented by a multi-country research consortium (Emerald: Emerging mental health systems in low- and middle-income countries) for (1) service users and caregivers, (2) service planners and policy-makers and (3) researchers in six LMICs (Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda). In this paper, we focus on the methodology being used to evaluate the impact of capacity-building in these three target groups. We first review the evidence base for approaches to evaluation of capacity-building, highlighting the gaps in this area. We then describe the adaptation of best practice for the Emerald capacity-building evaluation. The resulting mixed method evaluation framework was tailored to each target group and to each country context. We identified a need to expand the evidence base on indicators of successful capacity-building across the different target groups. To address this, we developed an evaluation plan to measure the adequacy and usefulness of quantitative capacity-building indicators when compared with qualitative evaluation. We argue that evaluation needs to be an integral part of capacity-building activities and that expertise needs to be built in methods of evaluation. The Emerald evaluation provides a potential model for capacity-building evaluation across key stakeholder groups and promises to extend understanding of useful indicators of success.","The partner organisations involved in the Emerald programme are Addis Ababa University (AAU), Ethiopia; Butabika National Mental Hospital (BNH), Uganda; ARTTIC, Germany; HealthNet TPO, Netherlands; King&#x27;s College London (KCL), United Kingdom (UK); Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), India; Transcultural Psychosocial Organization Nepal (TPO Nepal), Nepal; Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM), Spain; University of Cape Town (UCT), South Africa; University of Ibadan (UI), Nigeria; University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), South Africa; and World Health Organization (WHO), Switzerland.

A qualitative study,"BackgroundThis study is part of a longitudinal study among children and adolescents with HIV in both urban and rural Uganda: ‘Mental health among HIV infected CHildren and Adolescents in KAmpala and Masaka, Uganda (CHAKA)’.MethodThe study is constructed of both quantitative and qualitative components. In this article we report a qualitative study on the experiences of 21 adolescents (twelve to seventeen years) living with HIV in Uganda. The purpose of the study was to investigate both the protective and the risk factors in HIV-infected adolescents’ care environment in order to understand what might contribute to negative outcomes and what might provide a protective buffer against harmful life events. Semi-structured interviews with vignettes about mental disorders were employed and a phenomenological analysis was done.ResultsThe findings uncovered that the adolescents’ families were mostly characterized by instability and diffuse relationships that provided an insecure basis for secure attachment and emotional support. Even in stable and secure family environments, there was no guarantee for getting sufficient emotional support in order to develop a positive self-concept due to the fate being the only infected child in the family. Both secure attachment and positive self-concept are known psychological protective mechanisms that provide the individual with resilience. The adolescents in this study seemed hampered in the development of protective mechanisms and consequently seemed psychologically vulnerable and badly equipped for coping with challenges, which paves the way for the possible development of mental disorders.ConclusionTo change the focus towards strengthening the children and adolescents’ development of psychological protective mechanisms implicates a change in focus from illness to health and has consequences for both treatment and prevention. Psychological health promotion must be systemic and aim at strengthening the family environment, but also to establish peer group support.","Acknowledgements

This systematic review and meta-analysis set out to: (a) explore associations between PA and suicidal ideation (SI) levels, and (b) investigate the effect of PA interventions on SI.
METHODS: Major electronic databases were searched from inception up to 05/2017 to identify quantitative studies reporting an association between PA and SI. A quantitative correlates synthesis and random effects meta-analysis were conducted.
RESULTS: Fourteen of 21 studies in adults (67%) (n = 130,737), 7/14 (50%) in adolescents (n = 539,170) and 2/3 (67%) in older adults (n = 50,745) found a significant negative association between PA- and SI-levels. Pooled adjusted meta-analysis of 14 effect sizes over eight studies and 80,856 people found that those who were ""active"" versus those who were ""inactive"" were less likely to have SI (OR = 0.87, 95%CI = 0.76-0.98). Additionally, meeting PA guidelines conferred a significant protective effect against SI (OR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.51-0.99, P = 0.03; N studies = 3, n people = 122,395), while not meeting guidelines was associated with increased SI (OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.09-1.24, P < 0.001; N = 4, n = 78,860). Data from the intervention studies (N = 3, n = 121) was mixed and limited.
LIMITATIONS: Our findings are based mainly on cross-sectional studies, while the majority of studies did not include a rigorous physical activity assessment.
CONCLUSIONS: The current study suggests that higher PA levels are associated with lower SI. However, the associations observed need to be confirmed in prospective observational studies and controlled trials.",None.,Journal of Affective Disorders,,Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Attitude to Health; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Health Behavior; Humans; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Prospective Studies; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Young Adult,2017-08-24,2017,225,,438-448,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Hallgren, Mats; Firth, Joseph; Rosenbaum, Simon; Schuch, Felipe B.; Mugisha, James; Probst, Michel; Van Damme, Tine; Carvalho, André F.; Stubbs, Brendon","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven – University of Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium; KU Leuven – University of Leuven, University Psychiatric Centre, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium); Hallgren, Mats (Department of Public Health Sciences, Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden); Firth, Joseph (Institute of Brain, Behaviour and Mental Health, University of Manchester, UK; NICM, School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Australia); Rosenbaum, Simon (School of Psychiatry, UNSW Sydney, Australia; Black Dog Institute, Prince of Wales Hospital, Sydney, Australia); Schuch, Felipe B.

These juices' quality however is affected by factors like temperature, light, and microbiological contamination significantly changing physicochemical parameters and storage stability. Physicochemical and microbiological analyses of passion fruit, pineapple, and mango juices in dark and light bottles at 24°C and 4°C were conducted in Kampala, Uganda for 12 days. Physicochemical parameters significantly reduced (p < .05) storage stability of fresh juices, while no significant changes (p > .05) were observed for the microbiological analyses. pH values ranged from 3.0 to 4.2 (dark) bottles and 2.9 to 4.0 (light) bottles for juices at 24°C and 4°C. °Brix values were from 1.0 to 5.5 for dark and clear bottles at 24°C and 4°C. TTA (%) values ranged from 1.1 to 7.2 (dark) bottles and 1.1 to 7.4 for (light) bottles at 24°C and 4°C. Ascorbic acid content ranged from 3.5 to 61.0 mg/ 100 ml and 5.5 to 56.7 mg/100 ml for juices in dark and clear bottles, respectively. total plate counts ranged from 1.3 × 10___ to 3.3 × 107 CFU/ml (dark bottles at 24°C) to 3.5 × 10³ to 3.3 × 108 CFU/ml (dark bottles at 4°C). For juices in light bottles, total plate counts ranged from 1.8 × 10___ to 8.0 × 107 CFU/ml (24°C) and 2.7 × 10___ to 1.5 × 108 CFU/ml (4°C). High microbial loads suggest the use of poor processing techniques and lack of good hygiene which lower quality and reduce storage stability of juices. Storage temperature greatly reduces physicochemical parameters both at ambient and refrigeration temperatures. This implies that temperature control for unpasteurized juices is critical in order to inhibit microorganism metabolic activities which accelerate biodeterioration leading to spoilage and short shelf life. Fresh unpasteurized juices stored at 24°C and 4°C may safely be consumed within 1 and 2 days, respectively.",,Food Science & Nutrition,,,2017-08-19,2017,5,6,1098-1105,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kaddumukasa, Phoebe P.; Imathiu, Samuel M.; Mathara, Julius M.; Nakavuma, Jesca L.","Kaddumukasa, Phoebe P.

The aim of the current study was to investigate if there are differences in quality of life (QoL) outcomes between people with mental health problems that do and do not meet the recommendations of 150min per week of physical activity. 109 (36♀) Ugandan in- and outpatients (mean age = 34.2 ± 10.2 years) (depression = 7, bipolar disorder = 31, schizophrenia = 21, alcohol use disorder = 50) completed the Physical Activity Vital Sign (PAVS) method and World Health Organization Quality of Life Assessment brief version. Those who did not achieve the minimum physical activity recommendations as assessed by the PAVS (n = 63) had a lower physical, psychological, social and environmental QoL. The current data offer further evidence that the PAVS method might be an important risk identification tool in people with mental health problems. The feasibility and acceptability of the PAVS may help promote the importance of physical activity assessment and prescription as a core part of the treatment of mental health problems in LMICs.",None,Psychiatry Research,,Adult; Alcoholism; Bipolar Disorder; Depression; Environment; Exercise; Female; Health Resources; Health Surveys; Humans; Inpatients; Male; Mental Health; Outpatients; Quality of Life; Schizophrenia; Time Factors; Uganda; World Health Organization,2017-08-19,2017,258,,250-254,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Van Damme, Tine; Probst, Michel; Firth, Joseph; Stubbs, Brendon; Basangwa, David; Mugisha, James","Vancampfort, Davy (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; University Psychiatric Centre, KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium); Van Damme, Tine (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); Probst, Michel (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); Firth, Joseph (NICM, School of Science and Health, University of Western Sydney, Australia; Division of Psychology and Mental Health, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience (IoPPN), King's College London, London, UK); Basangwa, David (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda; Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven)","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Van Damme, Tine (KU Leuven); Probst, Michel (KU Leuven); Firth, Joseph (Western Sydney University; University of Manchester); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); Basangwa, David (); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)",12,10,1.22,4.84,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/76545044/Physical_activity_is_associated_VANCAMPFORT_Publishedonline19August2017_GREEN_AAM.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1091237459,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 17 Psychology and Cognitive Sciences; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1701 Psychology,

The sample consisted of 278 undergraduate science teacher-trainees selected from a large public university in northern Uganda. Data were collected using several scales from the modified Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, Academic Hope Scale, and College Persistence Questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling. Task value and academic hope significantly predicted students’ persistence. Academic hope made a greater contribution to students’ persistence compared to task value. The combined effect of task value and academic hope did not make any significant contribution to students’ persistence. The study highlights the need to strengthen students’ hopeful thinking and task value in order to increase their chances of completing their studies.

We investigated the relationship between arthritis and mental health (depression spectrum, psychosis spectrum, anxiety, sleep disturbances and stress) across community-dwelling adults aged ≥18 years across 46 countries from the World Health Survey. Symptoms of psychosis and depression were established using questions from the Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Severity of anxiety, sleep problems, and stress sensitivity over the preceding 30 days were self-reported. Self-report lifetime history of arthritis was collected, including presence or absence of symptoms suggestive of arthritis: pain, stiffness or swelling of joints over the preceding 12-months. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken. Overall, 245,706 individuals were included. Having arthritis increased the odds of subclinical psychosis (OR = 1.85; 95%CI = 1.72–1.99) and psychosis (OR = 2.48; 95%CI = 2.05–3.01). People with arthritis were at increased odds of subsyndromal depression (OR = 1.92; 95%CI = 1.64–2.26), a brief depressive episode (OR = 2.14; 95%CI = 1.88–2.43) or depressive episode (OR = 2.43; 95%CI = 2.21–2.67). Arthritis was also associated with increased odds for anxiety (OR = 1.75; 95%CI = 1.63–1.88), sleep problems (OR = 2.23; 95%CI = 2.05–2.43) and perceived stress (OR = 1.43; 95%CI = 1.33–1.53). Results were similar for middle-income and low-income countries. Integrated interventions addressing arthritis and mental health comorbidities are warranted to tackle this considerable burden.","BS receives funding from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research &amp; Care Funding scheme.

This paper discusses the ethical and methodological dilemmas inherent in studies on the Ugandan deaf community’s emancipation and sustainability. A first risk factor resides in the country’s political situation, strategy planning, financial management and pressures on democracy and human rights. Other risk factors are power hierarchies and questionable ideologies on the status of Ugandan Sign Language (UgSL) (factor 2) and the sometimes-scant attention to ethics in development partnerships (factor 3). These risks directly and indirectly enter the research space, for example, when participants warn that their own and the researcher’s safety could be compromised if certain information is divulged, resulting in social isolation, loss of income, and even threats to life and limb. Information sharing, transparency in partnerships, and attention to the status of UgSL are keys in the circumvention of these risks.

However, there is a paucity of multinational population data assessing the association between depression and pain, particularly among low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where both are common. Therefore, we investigated this association across 47 LMICs.
METHODS: Community-based data on 273 952 individuals from 47 LMICs were analysed. Multivariable logistic and linear regression analyses were performed to assess the association between the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision depression/depression subtypes (over the past 12 months) and pain in the previous 30 days based on self-reported data. Country-wide meta-analysis adjusting for age and sex was also conducted.
RESULTS: The prevalence of severe pain was 8.0, 28.2, 20.2, and 34.0% for no depression, subsyndromal depression, brief depressive episode, and depressive episode, respectively. Logistic regression adjusted for socio-demographic variables, anxiety and chronic medical conditions (arthritis, diabetes, angina, asthma) demonstrated that compared with no depression, subsyndromal depression, brief depressive episode, and depressive episode were associated with a 2.16 [95% confidence interval (CI) 1.83-2.55], 1.45 (95% CI 1.22-1.73), and 2.11 (95% CI 1.87-2.39) increase in odds of severe pain, respectively. Similar results were obtained when a continuous pain scale was used as the outcome. Depression was significantly associated with severe pain in 44/47 countries with a pooled odds ratio of 3.93 (95% CI 3.54-4.37).
CONCLUSION: Depression and severe pain are highly comorbid across LMICs, independent of anxiety and chronic medical conditions. Whether depression treatment or pain management in patients with comorbid pain and depression leads to better clinical outcome is an area for future research.","BS receives funding from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research and Care Funding scheme.

Data from the World Health Survey (2002-2004), including 229,293 adults, were analyzed. A perceived stress score (range, 0 (lowest stress)-100 (highest stress)) was computed on the basis of 2 questions from the Perceived Stress Scale. Eleven chronic conditions were assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to explore the associations. All chronic conditions were associated with significantly higher mean perceived stress scores, with the exception of edentulism. The associations were particularly strong for depression (β = 14.71, 95% confidence interval (CI): 13.68, 15.74), visual impairment (β = 10.66, 95% CI: 8.09, 13.23), and schizophrenia (β = 9.98, 95% CI: 7.71, 12.24). Compared with no chronic conditions, the β coefficients for perceived stress with the presence of 1, 2, 3, and ≥4 chronic conditions were 5.58 (95% CI: 4.94, 6.23), 9.58 (95% CI: 8.67, 10.49), 14.15 (95% CI: 12.63, 15.67), and 20.17 (95% CI: 18.29, 22.05), respectively. The associations with perceived stress were significantly stronger among the poorest individuals for arthritis, asthma, diabetes, edentulism, and ≥4 chronic conditions. Our data suggest that a range of chronic conditions and multimorbidity are associated with greatly increased perceived stress among people in low- and middle-income countries, and that the poorest persons may be a particularly vulnerable group.","Author affiliations: Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Biomedical Sciences Group, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium (Davy Vancampfort); University Psychiatric Center, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium (Davy Vancampfort, Marc De Hert); Research and Development Unit, Parc Sanitari Sant Joan de Déu, University of Barcelona, Fundació Sant Joan de Déu, Barcelona, Spain (Ai Koyanagi); Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Salud Mental, Monforte de Lemos and Madrid, Spain (Ai Koyanagi); Faculty of Medicine, School of Psychiatry, University of New South Wales, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia (Philip B.

Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to focus on this issue in the Malaysian construction industry.   Design/methodology/approach This paper targeted professional project consultants, who are identified as architects, engineers, and quantity surveyors, as the internal construction stakeholders. The personal-OV and the level of OC of the stakeholders were evaluated through a questionnaire survey. To achieve the research objective, comparative and hierarchical regression analyses were performed.   Findings The results generated by the analyses indicated a high level of value conflicts in the construction organizations which significantly and negatively affected commitment of the internal stakeholders.   Originality/value Value conflicts in construction organizations are the agenda of this paper while not many empirical studies have been conducted on this issue in Malaysia.

Thus, we investigated PA correlates among community-dwelling adults with depression in this setting.
METHODS: World Health Survey data included 24,230 adults (43.1 ± 16.1 years; 36.1% male) with ICD-10 diagnoses of depression including brief depressive episode and subsyndromal depression aged ≥ 18 years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Participants were dichotomised into low and moderate-to-high physically active groups. Associations between PA and a range of sociodemographic, health behaviour and mental and physical health variables were examined using multivariable logistic regressions.
RESULTS: 34.8% of participants with depression were physically inactive. In the multivariate analyses, inactivity was associated with male sex, older age, not being married/cohabiting, high socio-economic status, unemployment, living in an urban setting, less vegetable consumption, and poor sleep/ low energy. In addition, mobility difficulties and some somatic co-morbidity were associated with not complying with the 150min per week moderate-to-vigorous PA recommendations.

Library automation incorporates the adoption of integrated library systems. Effective adoption of an integrated library system enables broad-based access to global and local knowledge sources to solve local, regional and national development challenges. Using a sequential mixed methods approach in a case study of a Ugandan public university, Kyambogo University, this study investigated the perceptions of librarians, information workers and other university stakeholders with respect to library automation and the contribution thereof to national development. The results confirmed that the integrated library system improved library operations and played an important role in supporting national development.

According to this paradigm, markets and not states are the fundamental determinants of distributive justice and human flourishing through the promotion of economic growth that is believed to trickle down to the poor in due time. Despite the global intellectual criticism of this neo-liberal development economics orthodox of measuring development and wellbeing in terms of market induced economic growth, autocratic states in Sub-Saharan Africa that have accumulated un-dimensional growth continue to be applauded as role models on poverty reduction, wellbeing and social justice by donors and global development institutions such as the World Bank and international monetary fund (IMF). This is basically because they have wholly embraced the implementation of the anti-pro-poor neo-liberal structural adjustment tool kit. This study uses a critical hermeneutics methodology to expose the distortions embedded in neo-liberal gross domestic product (GDP) growth cartographies and how these disguise the social injustices against the poor in Sub-Saharan Africa with particular reference to Uganda.

Sediment samples were extracted and cleaned up for PAHs using UNEP, 1992, and EPA method 3630C protocols. The analysis of sample extracts was carried out using a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer. Fifteen congeners, mostly the high molecular weight PAHs (HPAHs) (4-6 rings) were detected. Total (∑) concentrations varied from 44.2 to 80.2 ng g-1 dry weight (d.w.) at the Napoleon Gulf, while those at the Murchison Bay ranged from 17.0 to 55.0 ng g-1 d.w.

Addressing physical health needs should have a central role in reducing the burden and facilitating recovery in people with severe mental illness (SMI). We systematically investigated (1) physical health policies in the current mental health plans, and (2) the routine metabolic screening rates for people with SMI in SSA.MethodsThe Mental Health Atlas and MiNDbank of the World Health Organization were screened for physical health policies in mental health plans. Next, we systematically searched PubMed from inception until February 1st, 2017 for relevant studies on metabolic screening rates in people with SMI in SSA.ResultsThe current systematic review shows that in 22 screened plans only 6 made reference to a physical health component or policy. Only the South-African mental health plan reported about routine screening and treatment of physical illness for people with SMI. In 2 South-African studies (n = 431) routine screening was unacceptably low with less than 1% adequately screened for all modifiable metabolic syndrome risk factors.ConclusionsOur review data clearly show that a physical health policy is yet to be embraced in mental health care systems of most SSA countries. There is a clear need for integrated mental and medical services in SSA. All psychiatric services, including poorly developed community-based primary health care settings should standardly assess the body mass index and waist circumference at initiation of psycho-pharmacotherapy, and afterwards at regular intervals. Optimal monitoring should include assessments of fasting glucose, lipids, cholesterol, and blood pressure. Mental health care providers in SSA countries need to be informed that their roles extend beyond taking care of the mental health of their patients and assume responsibility for the physical health of their patients as well. Policy makers should be made aware that investment in continued medial education and in screening for physical health risks could optimize mental and physical health improvements. The increased physical health needs of people with mental illness should be integrated into the existing Information, Education and Communication public health awareness programs of the World Health Organization.",Authors’ contributionsDV and BS collected the data.

The education sector has received increasing scrutiny, owing to its centrality in promoting the national agenda of countries. The higher education sub-sector has expanded in its drive to increase accessibility, albeit with numerous challenges and doubts, especially about the quality of education. Numerous evaluations in this sub-sector in Uganda have been carried out, but their results have not been used for effective decision-making. In this regard, the non-utilisation trend of evaluation findings is attributable to the design of the institutions where these evaluations are carried out.Objectives: The study examined the relationship between institutional design (procedural rules, evaluation processes and institutional capacity) and utilisation of evaluation results at Kyambogo University.Methodology: This was a cross-sectional survey involving a sample of 118 respondents whose views were obtained through the use of questionnaires and key informant interviews triangulated with documentary analysis.Results: The study found that procedural rules, evaluation processes and evaluation capacity had a positive (0.459, 0.486 and 0.765, respectively) and a statistically significant (sig. = 0.000) effect on utilisation of evaluation results. This means that the dimensions of institutional design were important predictors of utilisation of evaluation results by a public sector agency.Conclusion: Strengthening of the evaluation competences and capacity of the university by empowering the Directorate of Planning and Development to coordinate and harmonise all evaluations and be charged with the follow-up of utilisation of the results is an emerging recommendation from this study.",,African Evaluation Journal,,,2017-04-12,2017,5,1,,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kabuye, James; Basheka, Benon C.","Kabuye, James (); Basheka, Benon C.

There are many factors slackening production, of which working conditions is part. A complete inquiry into the workers' working conditions can enable managements to reduce risks in the workplaces and improve productivity. Understanding and awareness of the benefits of workplace research and a probe into the working conditions in the Ugandan apparel assembly plants are urgently required.
Methods: A total of 103 (70 women and 33 men) workers from five different plants were interviewed. Together with the top management of various plants, questionnaires about the workers' opinions of their physical working conditions were prepared. Data was collected using two methods: (1) questionnaire; and (2) observation of the workers during their work.
Results: The results indicated that poor plant working conditions were mainly contributed by the workers' social factors and the management policies.
Conclusion: The government, together with the management, should work to improve the working conditions in the apparel assembly plants, as it greatly affects both.","Special thanks to Rebecca Nekesa, a lecturer at Kyambogo University, for her valuable advice and guidance throughout this research.

This study explored physical health multimorbidity in people with clinical depression, subsyndromal depression and brief depressive episode across 43 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
METHOD: Cross-sectional, community-based data on 190 593 individuals from 43 LMICs recruited via the World Health Survey were analysed. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was done to assess the association between depression and physical multimorbidity.
RESULTS: Overall, two, three and four or more physical health conditions were present in 7.4, 2.4 and 0.9% of non-depressive individuals compared with 17.7, 9.1 and 4.9% among people with any depressive episode, respectively. Compared with those with no depression, subsyndromal depression, brief depressive episode and depressive episode were significantly associated with 2.62, 2.14 and 3.44 times higher odds for multimorbidity, respectively. A significant positive association between multimorbidity and any depression was observed across 42 of the 43 countries, with particularly high odds ratios (ORs) in China (OR 8.84), Laos (OR 5.08), Ethiopia (OR 4.99), the Philippines (OR 4.81) and Malaysia (OR 4.58). The pooled OR for multimorbidity and depression estimated by meta-analysis across 43 countries was 3.26 (95% confident interval 2.98-3.57).
CONCLUSIONS: Our large multinational study demonstrates that physical health multimorbidity is increased across the depression spectrum. Public health interventions are required to address this global health problem.","This article received no specific funding or grant.

The present review provides a systematic quantitative review of the physical activity correlates in people with HIV/AIDS.
METHODS: Major electronic databases were searched till August 2016. Keywords included ""physical activity"" or ""exercise"" or ""sports"" and ""AIDS"" or ""HIV"".
RESULTS: Out of 55 correlates from 45 studies (N = 13,167; mean age range = 30.5-58.3 years; 63.2% male) five consistent (i.e., reported in four or more studies) correlates were identified. Lower levels of physical activity were consistently associated with older age (6/10 studies), a lower educational level (6/7), a lower number of CD4 cells/μl (7/11), exposure to antiviral therapy (4/6), and the presence of lipodystrophy (4/4). Other important barriers were the presence of bodily pain (2/2), depression (3/3), and opportunistic infections (3/4). Facilitators were a higher cardiorespiratory fitness level (3/3), a higher self-efficacy (2/2), more perceived benefits (2/2), and a better health motivation (3/3).
CONCLUSIONS: The current review has elucidated that participation in physical activity by people with HIV/AIDS is associated with a range of complex factors which should be considered in rehabilitation programs. Implications for Rehabilitation Health care professionals should consider HIV-related bodily pain and feelings of depression when assisting people living with HIV in inititiating and maintaining an active lifestyle. Interventions to improve self-efficacy and motivation, and to help people living with HIV in understanding the benefits of exercise, may encourage greater participation.",All authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest relevant to the content of this review.,Disability and Rehabilitation,,Age Factors; Antiviral Agents; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cardiorespiratory Fitness; Depression; Educational Status; Exercise; HIV Infections; Health Behavior; Humans; Lipodystrophy; Motivation; Opportunistic Infections; Pain; Self Efficacy,2017-03-22,2017,40,14,1-12,"All OA; Green, Accepted & Submitted",Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Mugisha, James; Richards, Justin; De Hert, Marc; Probst, Michel; Stubbs, Brendon","Vancampfort, Davy (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven – University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium; ; University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, KU Leuven – University of Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium;, Correspondencedavy.vancampfort@kuleuven.be, View further author information); Mugisha, James (Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda; ; Department of Sociology and Social Administration, Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda;, View further author information); Richards, Justin (School of Public Health & Charles Perkins Centre, University of Sydney, Sydney, NSW, Australia;, View further author information); De Hert, Marc (University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, KU Leuven – University of Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium;, View further author information); Probst, Michel (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, KU Leuven – University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium;, View further author information); Stubbs, Brendon (Department of Physiotherapy, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK; ; Department of Health Service and Population Research, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK, View further author information)",,"Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University); Richards, Justin (University of Sydney); De Hert, Marc (KU Leuven); Probst, Michel (KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust)",29,20,5.34,12.7,https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/66395996/Physical_activity_correlates_in_VANCAMPFORT_Accepted10March2017_GREEN_AAM.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084162606,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1103 Clinical Sciences,

For PwDs to use ICTs and ICT enabled services, they need appropriate Assistive Technologies. Therefore, mainstream ICTs and ICT enabled services must be adapted to work with assistive technologies. The adapted ICTs are commonly called inclusive ICTs. In Uganda, the status of provision and support for use of inclusive ICTs in general and in the education of PwDs in particular, is not known. A few studies have reported low level accessibility of ICT and ICT enabled services for PwDs but at a general level. Therefore, more effort is needed not only to report the status but also to address the gaps. Relevant policies such as the 2011 Draft1 Special Needs and Inclusive Education policy, the Uganda National ICT policy, the Rural Communication Development Fund (RCDF) and the Government of Uganda Website Standards are all silent about making ICTs accessible in general and in the education for PwDs in particular. This paper reports results of an audit of inclusive ICTs for education of PwDs in Uganda. The study was an implementation of the first phase of the UNESCO policy on inclusive ICTs in education for PwDs in Uganda.

Although, medicinal plants are collected from different habitats, most of them are collected from the wild. Claims indicate that men use more forest products than women; and that women prefer younger vegetation succession stages as compared to those preferred by men for harvesting medicinal plants. However, there was no documented evidence to ascertain these claims. This study documented medicinal plants and investigated the influence of gender in the collection of these plants around Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. The plants used by various categories of herbalists were collected, identified and listed. The differences between herbalist categories regarding medicinal plant collection and use were studied using both qualitative and quantitative participatory rural appraisal (PRA) methods. Two hundred and ninety five species encompassing all growth forms were listed with herbs and shrubs being most frequently used and majority (70%) of these occurred outside the forest.

Comparative case studies at the national level, using a common research design, show that teaching, despite being an attractive civil service job, offers low salaries and many challenges, especially when it takes place in rural areas. Combining professional duties with demanding family responsibilities further diminishes women’s ability to stay in the teaching profession. The studies in this book attempt to bridge research findings with policy by developing action plans in cooperation with ministries of education of the respective countries. Women Teachers in Africa will be of interest to academic researchers, undergraduate and postgraduate students in the relevant fields, as well as development professionals, aid agency staff and education policy experts.ii iii iv v vi",,,,,2017-02-10,2017,,,,Closed,Monograph,"Stromquist, Nelly P.; Haugen, Caitlin S.; Klees, Steven J.; Stromquist, Nelly P.; Lin, Jing; Choti, Truphena; Corneilse, Carol; Stromquist, Nelly P.; Lin, Jing; Corneilse, Carol; Klees, Steven J.; Choti, Truphena; Haugen, Caitlin S.; Lin, Jing; Mlama, Penina; Swai, Anna; Klees, Steven J.; Jawoko, Elizabeth Nyivuru; Muwanga, Nansozi K.; Stromquist, Nelly P.; Agounké, Jeannine; Tchitou, Ibitola; Stromquist, Nelly P.; Klees, Steven J.","Stromquist, Nelly P.

The field research was carried out in private and public universities. Every university had a financial policies so their line managers were expected to perform their duties effectively. The objectives of the study were to: assess the relationship between financial policies and departmental budgets; analyse the effect of budgets on the performance of line managers; and evaluate the influence of financial policy on the performance of line managers. The influence of financial policies on budgeting was established at 31%; the relationship between the budget function and performance was established at 18 %; and the effect of financial policies on the performance of line managers was established at 48%. The total causal effect was 54%. Therefore, the study recommended adoption of financial policies enhancing the performance of line managers.

We hypothesized that the indigenous people of Eastern Uganda have used T. indica for generations and developed practices that promote its conservation and therefore we expected that they possess an elaborate indigenous knowledge (IK) system and that most of them have planted the species. The aim of this study was to assess the influence of IK, attitudes and practices on the use and conservation of T. indica.MethodsA cross sectional survey was conducted in two districts purposively selected from the T. indica natural range. Focus group discussions, key informant interviews, semi-structured interviews and observation were used to collect data. Data was processed using qualitative analytical methods.ResultsTamarindus indica was highly valued by the majority of the population. Tamarindus indica was used for food, medicinal, cultural, social, environmental amelioration and income generation purposes. The population possessed a high level of IK about T. indica evidenced by 18 categories of uses and multiple modes of use. Fruit pulp was the most commonly used tamarind product. Relative frequency of citation of the different uses provides insight into usage levels and IK possessed. The communities’ food and medicinal uses concurred with scientific reports of health benefits of consuming T. indica. Approximately half of respondents had T. indica on their compounds or homegardens (53%). Fifty two percent of the tamarind population was self-propagated, 45% were planted while the propagation history for the remaining 3% was not known. Constraints towards planting T. indica included limited land, long maturation period and low monetary value. Fifty three percent of those who were growing T. indica did not carry out any silvicultural practices. The majority of T. indica encountered (87%) was intercropped with other crops or trees. Several beliefs and taboos regarding T. indica persist.ConclusionTamarindus indica has a high use value in the study area evidenced by multiple uses. Indigenous knowledge and uses concurred with scientifically proven nutritional and medicinal attributes of T. indica in literature which is significant given current trends towards affordable functional foods. The high level of IK has not translated into high rates of planting T. indica. There is need to encourage value-addition so as to maximize T. indica benefits and enhance conservation.","AcknowledgementsMany thanks to field assistants, all respondents who shared information and tamarind owners for allowing us to carry out studies on their land.

This is an important research gap, given the rapid increase in the prevalence of chronic diseases associated with lifestyle changes in these countries. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the association between chronic conditions, multimorbidity and low physical activity (PA) among community-dwelling adults in 46 LMICs, and explore the mediators of these relationships.MethodsWorld Health Survey data included 228,024 adults aged ≥18 years from 46 LMICs. PA was assessed by the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Nine chronic physical conditions (chronic back pain, angina, arthritis, asthma, diabetes, hearing problems, tuberculosis, visual impairment and edentulism) were assessed. Multivariable logistic regression and mediation analyses were used to assess the association between chronic conditions or multimorbidity and low PA.ResultsOverall, in the multivariable analysis, arthritis (OR = 1.12), asthma (1.19), diabetes (OR = 1.33), edentulism (OR = 1.46), hearing problems (OR = 1.90), tuberculosis (OR = 1.24), visual impairment (OR = 2.29), multimorbidity (OR = 1.31; 95% CI = 1.21–1.42) were significantly associated with low PA. More significant associations were observed in individuals aged ≥50 years. In older adults, depression mediated between 5.1% (visual impairment) to 23.5% (angina) of the association between a chronic condition and low PA. Mobility difficulties explained more than 25% of the association for seven of the eight chronic conditions. Pain was a strong mediator for angina (65.9%) and arthritis (64.9%), while sleep problems mediated up to 43.7% (angina) of the association.ConclusionsIn LMICs, those with chronic conditions and multimorbidity are significantly less physically active (especially older adults). Research on the efficacy and effectiveness of PA in the management of chronic diseases in LMICs is urgently needed. Targeted promotion of physical activity to populations in LMICs experiencing chronic conditions may ameliorate associated depression, mobility difficulties and pain that are themselves important barriers for initiating or adopting an active lifestyle.","AcknowledgementsNone.FundingBrendon Stubbs receives funding from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research &amp; Care Funding scheme.

The education of the girl child is largely challenging by among other factors negative community attitudes towards the girl’s education. A girl child with disability experiences double disadvantage of the disabling condition and denial of education. This chapter examines how challenges towards the education of a girl child with disability are being addressed in Kampala City Council Authority (KCCA) primary schools. This chapter, specifically and critically analyses the strategies being undertaken by the KCCA and a development partner – Cheshire Services Uganda, an NGO dealing in disability and education in KCCA to bring about an inclusive education environment. It presents how the human resource, educational facilities and learning opportunities are made accessible and adaptable to all learners regardless of one’s (dis)ability. The chapter further explores the relevance, effectiveness and sustainability of these strategies. It identifies and discusses how factors such as health, economics of disability, attitude and psychosocial factors influence inclusive education for the girl child with disability. Enabling factors for every school going age girl child with disability in KCCA schools to access mainstream schools in her community is identified. How effective these strategies are in bringing about a school which includes everybody, celebrates difference, supports learning, and responds to individual needs are documented. Lastly strategies for sustainability by individual schools and communities after the expiry of support from Cheshire Services Uganda concludes.",,Springer International Handbooks of Education,Second International Handbook of Urban Education,,2017-01-07,2017,,,51-65,Closed,Chapter,"Eron, Lawrence; Emong, Paul","Eron, Lawrence (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda); Emong, Paul (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda)","Eron, Lawrence (Kyambogo University)","Eron, Lawrence (Kyambogo University); Emong, Paul (Kyambogo University)",0,0,,0.0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1001271025,11 Medical and Health Sciences; 1303 Specialist Studies In Education; 13 Education; 1117 Public Health and Health Services; 1302 Curriculum and Pedagogy,4 Quality Education

In this study, we focused on the health systems required to support integration of mental health into primary health care (PHC) in Ethiopia, India, Nepal, Nigeria, South Africa and Uganda.MethodsA checklist guided by the World Health Organization Assessment Instrument for Mental Health Systems (WHO-AIMS) was developed and was used for data collection in each of the six countries participating in the Emerging mental health systems in low and middle-income countries (Emerald) research consortium. The documents reviewed were from the following domains: mental health legislation, health policies/plans and relevant country health programs. Data were analyzed using thematic content analysis.ResultsThree of the study countries (Ethiopia, Nepal, Nigeria, and Uganda) were working towards developing mental health legislation. South Africa and India were ahead of other countries, having enacted recent Mental Health Care Act in 2004 and 2016, respectively. Among all the 6 study countries, only Nepal, Nigeria and South Africa had a standalone mental health policy. However, other countries had related health policies where mental health was mentioned. The lack of fully fledged policies is likely to limit opportunities for resource mobilization for the mental health sector and efforts to integrate mental health into PHC. Most countries were found to be allocating inadequate budgets from the health budget for mental health, with South Africa (5%) and Nepal (0.17%) were the countries with the highest and lowest proportions of health budgets spent on mental health, respectively. Other vital resources that support integration such as human resources and health facilities for mental health services were found to be in adequate in all the study countries. Monitoring and evaluation systems to support the integration of mental health into PHC in all the study countries were also inadequate.ConclusionIntegration of mental health into PHC will require addressing the resource limitations that have been identified in this study. There is a need for up to date mental health legislation and policies to engender commitment in allocating resources to mental health services.","Authors’ contributionsJM lead design, analysis and writing of the paper.

Implementation of physical activity (PA) within the rehabilitation of people with mental health problems (PMHP) could reduce the burden and facilitate recovery. The objective of the current review was to explore (1) the role of PA within mental health policies of SSA countries, and (2) the current research evidence for PA to improve mental health in SSA.
METHODS: We screened the Mental Health Atlas and MiNDbank for mental health policies in SSA countries and searched PubMed for relevant studies on PA in PMHP in SSA.
RESULTS: Sixty-nine percent (=33/48) of SSA countries have a dedicated mental health policy. Two of 22 screened mental health policies included broad physical activity recommendations. There is clear evidence for the role of PA in the prevention and rehabilitation of depression in SSA.
CONCLUSION: Despite the existing evidence, PA is largely a neglected rehabilitation modality in the mental health care systems of SSA. Continued education of existing staff, training of specialized professionals and integration of PA for mental health in public health awareness programs are needed to initiate and improve PA programs within the mental health care systems of SSA.",,Pan African Medical Journal,,Africa South of the Sahara; Depression; Exercise; Health Policy; Humans; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Mental Health Services,2017-01-01,2017,26,,104,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vancampfort, Davy; Stubbs, Brendon; De Hert, Marc; du Plessis, Christy; Gbiri, Caleb Ademola Omuwa; Kibet, Jepkemoi; Wanyonyi, Nancy; Mugisha, James","Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven - University of Leuven, Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, Leuven, Belgium.; KU Leuven - University of Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium.); Stubbs, Brendon (Physiotherapy Department, South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, London, UK.; Health Service and Population Research Department, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, De Crespigny Park, London, UK.); De Hert, Marc (KU Leuven - University of Leuven, University Psychiatric Center KU Leuven, Leuven-Kortenberg, Belgium.); du Plessis, Christy (University of the Free State, Bloemfontein, South Africa.); Gbiri, Caleb Ademola Omuwa (College of Medicine, University of Lagos, Nigeria.; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Pretoria, South Africa.); Kibet, Jepkemoi (Center for Victims of Torture, Nairobi, Kenya.); Wanyonyi, Nancy (Department of Orthopaedics and Rehabilitation, Moi University College of Health Sciences, Eldoret, Kenya.); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.; Butabika National Referral and Mental Health Hospital, Kampala, Uganda.)",,"Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Stubbs, Brendon (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust; King's College London); De Hert, Marc (KU Leuven); du Plessis, Christy (University of the Free State); Gbiri, Caleb Ademola Omuwa (University of Lagos; University of Pretoria); Kibet, Jepkemoi (); Wanyonyi, Nancy (Moi University); Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University)",15,6,1.24,5.71,https://doi.org/10.11604/pamj.2017.26.104.10051,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084234217,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,

This study is cross–sectional and correlational. This study utilizes multiple regression models based on a sample of 52 government hospitals. The study’s unit of inquiry is hospital directors and accountants. The correlation results indicate a significant positive relationship between managerial competencies and accountability. The study further finds that board governance is not significantly correlated with accountability of government hospitals. In terms of hospital governance dimensions; board composition is positively and significantly related with accountability unlike board structure and board independence. The measurements used in all the predictor variables may not perfectly represent all the dimensions although they have been defined as precisely as possible by drawing upon relevant literature. Therefore, further research on other factors that explain the variance in accountability in the health sector is needed. Whereas hitherto, corporate governance and managerial competencies had been viewed as possible explanations of accountability in the public healthcare systems, this study only confirms managerial competencies to be a significant predictor of accountability in the public healthcare systems unlike board governance.",,Cogent Business & Management,,,2017-01-01,2017,4,1,1334995,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bakalikwira, Lasuli; Bananuka, Juma; Kaawaase Kigongo, Twaha; Musimenta, Doreen; Mukyala, Veronica; Ntim, Collins G.","Bakalikwira, Lasuli (Department of Accounting, Makerere University Business School, Makerere, Uganda); Bananuka, Juma (Department of Accounting, Makerere University Business School, Makerere, Uganda); Kaawaase Kigongo, Twaha (Department of Accounting, Makerere University Business School, Makerere, Uganda); Musimenta, Doreen (Department of Accounting, Makerere University Business School, Makerere, Uganda); Mukyala, Veronica (Department of Accounting, Makerere University Business School, Makerere, Uganda); Ntim, Collins G.

At the chosen ΔTmin of 10℃, the minimum cooling and heating utility requirements of the brewery studied were determined as being 4862.21 kW and 8294.21 kW respectively, with a pinch temperature at 68℃. It was observed that using the technique, 1806.59 kW of energy could be recovered through process to process heat exchange which presented an energy saving potential of 21.5%. It is recommended that results from this study could be used in the design or retrofit of a heat exchanger network of a brewery for improved energy efficiency. Considerations can also be made for other values of ΔTmin.",,Energy and Power Engineering,,,2017,2017,09,01,11-21,All OA; Gold,Article,"Tibasiima, Noah; Okullo, Aldo","Tibasiima, Noah (); Okullo, Aldo ()",,"Tibasiima, Noah (); Okullo, Aldo ()",4,3,,1.15,http://www.scirp.org/journal/PaperDownload.aspx?paperID=73465,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084456381,0915 Interdisciplinary Engineering; 09 Engineering,7 Affordable and Clean Energy

The numeral solution to the stiff ordinary differential equations was performed by building a custom module which was used with the inbuilt NumPy and matplotlib modules that come with the Anaconda python distro. Python was used in order to obtain a realistic solution that considers the gel, glass and cage effects that affect the non-linear polymerization kinetics established in literature. The results showed that a maximum monomer conversion of about 92.8% at a minimum batch time of about 2.2 hours could be achieved at the specified conditions to obtain a polydisperse polymer with an index of 27.

Deep excavations are supported by conventional retaining walls: sheet pile walls, braced walls, diaphragm walls and secant pile walls. An advantage of secant pile wall compared with other excavation supporting systems is that they are the most economical methods of creating an effective water control barriers for building structural walls. The analysis of these deep excavations requires considerations of; nonlinear, dynamic and involves consideration of soil parameters, deformation, interaction of soil and retaining configuration. Thus, in order to accurately describe the behaviour of the anchored secant pile for earthquake loading, 3D finite element simulation was applied. The study considering earth pressure, plastic analysis, and soil deformation was carried out. The analysis indicated that for 20 m excavation step in fourth stage, incremental lateral displacement was 55.2 mm and total displacement was 110.4 mm. The analysis indicated that the deeper the foundation, the larger the deformation. The real accelerogram of Loma Prieta earthquake at Del Valle Dam Station with moment magnitude 7.1 occurring at epicentral distance 66 (18 Oct, 1989) was used in the study. In order to accurately study the response of the anchored secant pile to earthquake loading; it is suggested to carry out the relevant tests to determine the right stiffness parameters.

This study attempts to explain long-term variations of the IMB water quality and to provide a plausible water quality model. Because intermittent monitoring around the Bay hinders accurate determination of pollution, concentrations at the extreme northern shores (hotspots) are considered indicative of the pollutant loading into the bay. Delft3D-Flow was applied to study the Bay hydrodynamics and coupled with the Delwaq module to investigate water quality processes related to oxygen: organic and nutrient components i.e. dissolved oxygen (DO), biological oxygen demand (BOD) and ammonium (NH4+). It is found that the IMB water quality deteriorated exponentially in the period 2001–2014 due to increased pollution and the high residence time of water. The worst water quality was in 2010 when diffuse pollution intensified due to the lining of more drainage channels within Kampala City in addition to the declining wetland effect. The water quality towards the Outer Murchison Bay (OMB) deteriorated over time with dilution accounting for 40–60% of pollutant reduction. Although the effect of lake level variations is negligible compared to pollution into the IMB, increased lake levels after 2011 improved DO levels and mixing and hence BOD levels in the IMB.","The authors would like to thank the Flemish Interuniversity Council or Vlaamse Interuniversitaire Raad (VLIR) of Belgium for funding this research under the VLIR-ICP PhD programme.

We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate physical activity levels and its predictors in PLWH.
METHODS: PubMed, PsycARTICLES, and CINAHL Plus were searched by two independent reviewers from inception till 1 April 2016 using the keywords: ""HIV"" OR ""AIDS"" AND ""physical activity"" OR ""exercise"" OR ""sports"". A random effects meta-analysis was conducted.
RESULTS: Across 24 studies including 34 physical activity levels there were 3780 (2471♂) PLWH (mean age range: 37-58 years). PLWH spent 98.9 (95%CI = 64.8-133.1) minutes per day being physically active which is lower than in most other populations with chronic diseases. 50.7% (95%CI = 39.3-62%) (n = 2052) of PLWH complied with the physical activity guidelines of 150 min moderate intensity physical activity per week. The number of steps walked per day in 252 PLWH was 5899 (95%CI = 5678-6418), which is below the 10,000 steps per day recommendation.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that a considerable proportion of PLWH are insufficiently physically active. Future lifestyle interventions specifically targeting the prevention of physical inactivity in PLWH are warranted.

The cumulative number of NCD risk factors exhibited by an individual depicts a disease burden. However, understanding the risk factors associated with increased NCD burden has been constrained by scarcity of nationally representative data, especially in the developing countries and not well explored in the developed countries as well.MethodsAssessment of key risk factors for NCDs using population data drawn from 3987 participants in a nationally representative baseline survey in Uganda was made. Five key risk factors considered for the indicator variable included: high frequency of tobacco smoking, less than five servings of fruit and vegetables per day, low physical activity levels, high body mass index and raised blood pressure. We developed a composite indicator dependent variable with counts of number of risk factors associated with NCDs per participant. A statistical modeling framework was developed and a multinomial logistic regression model was fitted. The endogenous and exogenous predictors of NCD cumulative risk factors were assessed.ResultsA novel model framework for cumulative number of NCD risk factors was developed. Most respondents, 38 · 6% exhibited one or two NCD risk factors each. Of the total sample, 56 · 4% had at least two risk factors whereas only 5.3% showed no risk factor at all. Body mass index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, consumption of fruit and vegetables, age, region, residence, type of residence and land tenure system were statistically significant predictors of number of NCD risk factors (p","AcknowledgementThe authors are grateful to the research participants who volunteered to participate in the NCD risk factor prevalence survey; and for the technical and administrative support provided by Uganda’s Ministry of Health, and that from the Uganda Bureau of Statistics.

AIM: We explored the prevalence of suicidal ideation, attempt, associated psychiatric disorders and HIV/AIDS in post-conflict Northern Uganda, an area that experienced civil strife for over two decades.
METHODS: A total of 2400 respondents (aged 18 and above) and randomly selected in three districts (Gulu, Amuru and Nwoya), were interviewed. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess for associations between suicidality (suicidal ideation and attempt) and psychiatric cormorbidities.
RESULTS: The prevalence of suicidal ideation and attempt were 12.1 % and 6.2 % respectively. Suicidality was significantly (P<0.001) higher among respondents with major depressive disorder (adjusted Odds Ratio (OR) = 9.5; 95%CI= 7.4, 12.1) and post-traumatic stress disorder (adjusted OR =2.4; 95%CI= 1.6, 3.6). Men had lower odds of ideating or attempting suicide compared to women (adjusted OR = 0.55; 95%CI: 0.38, 0.82).
CONCLUSION: The prevalence rate of suicide ideation and attempt indicate a major public health problem in post-conflict Northern Uganda. Effective public mental health programs that that target both suicidality and psychiatric co-morbodities will be vital. Special attention should be given to women in post conflict Northern Uganda.",,African Health Sciences,,"Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide, Attempted; Uganda; War Exposure; Young Adult",2016-12,2016,16,4,1027-1035,All OA; Gold,Article,"Mugisha, James; Muyinda, Herbert; Kagee, Ashraf; Wandiembe, Peter; Mpugu, Stephen Kiwuwa; Vancampfort, Davy; Kinyanda, Eugene","Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University, Kampala, Uganda.; Makerere University, Child Health and Development Centre, School of Medicine, Mulago Hill, Kampala, Uganda.; Stellenbosch University, Department of Psychology, South Africa.); Muyinda, Herbert (Makerere University, Child Health and Development Centre, School of Medicine, Mulago Hill, Kampala, Uganda.); Kagee, Ashraf (Stellenbosch University, Department of Psychology, South Africa.); Wandiembe, Peter (Department of Statistical Methods, Makerere University, COBAMS, Makerere Hill, Kampala Uganda.); Mpugu, Stephen Kiwuwa (Makerere University, Child Health and Development Centre, School of Medicine, Mulago Hill, Kampala, Uganda.); Vancampfort, Davy (Department of Rehabilitation Sciences, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium.; University Psychiatric Centre University of Leuven, Kortenberg, Belgium.); Kinyanda, Eugene (MRC/UVRI Uganda Research Unit on AIDS, Uganda/MRC-DFID African Leadership Award, 50-59 Nakiwogo Street, Entebbe, Uganda.; Department of Psychiatry, Makerere University College of Health Sciences, School of Health Sciences Makerere Hill, Kampala, Uganda.)",,"Mugisha, James (Kyambogo University; Makerere University; Stellenbosch University); Muyinda, Herbert (Makerere University); Kagee, Ashraf (Stellenbosch University); Wandiembe, Peter (Makerere University); Mpugu, Stephen Kiwuwa (Makerere University); Vancampfort, Davy (KU Leuven; KU Leuven); Kinyanda, Eugene (Uganda Virus Research Institute; Makerere University)",5,2,0.71,1.55,https://www.ajol.info/index.php/ahs/article/download/152537/142126,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084460794,1117 Public Health and Health Services; 11 Medical and Health Sciences,"16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

Texture and color (instrumental) were determined by a universal testing machine (UTM) and colorimetry respectively to ascertain the kinetics of bananas during ripening. While deterministic, descriptive and ranking sensory tests were employed for sensory attributes characterisation. Seven banana color ripening stages were used for color variation and three temperatures (16, 23 and 30 °C) were used to study the kinetics, L, a, b and ΔE were calculated and axial puncture force, PF determined. Logistic model and first order reaction models were used.

However, little is known about physical health multimorbidity in this population or in people with subclinical psychosis and in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study explores physical health multimorbidity patterns among people with psychosis or subclinical psychosis.MethodsOverall, data from 242,952 individuals from 48 LMICs, recruited via the World Health Survey, were included in this cross-sectional study. Participants were subdivided into those (1) with a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (“psychosis”); (2) with more than one psychotic symptom in the past 12 months, but no lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (“subclinical psychosis”); and (3) without psychotic symptoms in the past 12 months or a lifetime diagnosis of psychosis (“controls”). Nine operationalized somatic disorders were examined: arthritis, angina pectoris, asthma, diabetes, chronic back pain, visual impairment, hearing problems, edentulism, and tuberculosis. The association between psychosis and multimorbidity was assessed by multivariable logistic regression analysis.ResultsThe prevalence of multimorbidity (i.e., two or more physical health conditions) was: controls = 11.4% (95% CI, 11.0–11.8%); subclinical psychosis = 21.8% (95% CI, 20.6–23.0%), and psychosis = 36.0% (95% CI, 32.1–40.2%) (P","AcknowledgementsBS and FG receive funding from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research &amp; Care Funding scheme.

The paper adopted a cross-sectional survey that included both quantitative and qualitative approaches to find out if responsibility accounting matters. The qualitative data supplement quantitative data. The findings indicate that there is a system of responsibility accounting. Costs and revenues are managed at respective departments. Heads of department have authority to manage their budget-allocated estimates. They are responsible for their decisions against their budgets or votes.

This paper addresses the research question, how did the diffusion of GIS technology occur in Uganda? Mixed methods were used for data collection, and analysis was performed using a theoretical framework called the diffusion of innovations (DOI). The results of the study showed that the adoption of GIS by institutions in Uganda occurred in a classic diffusion pattern consistent with diffusion theory. Adoption of GIS was promoted by its relative advantage over, and compatibility with, existing technologies. It was characterized by both heterophilous and homophilous communication channels, and influenced by change agents and champions. Its rate of adoption followed an S-shaped diffusion curve, and was hampered by bureaucracy, and patronage-based societal norms. This study makes a contribution to literature on GIS diffusion in developing countries.","The authors would like to thank the Interdisciplinary Center for the Study of Global Change (ICGC), University of Minnesota – Twin Cities, and the Compton Foundation for their financial support towards this doctoral research.

This study which was conducted at Kyambogo University highlights that in practice, public authorities still play a central role in the regulation of higher education systems more especially in the appointment and dismissal of academic staff. Despite the fact that the ministry has moved away from direct state control towards more “indirect” steering mechanisms, universities often continue to lack autonomy in many crucial areas, particularly in terms of filling staff positions. The purpose of this study therefore was to establish the level of institutional autonomy in academic staff appointment and removal at Kyambogo University. The researchers analysed each dimen¬sion of university autonomy in terms of appointment and dismissal of academic staff. We found out that appointment and removal of the academic staff in Kyambogo University was not in line with what is provided for in the Human Resource Manual and national guiding Acts, Laws and Standing orders.

This study explored the global prevalence of anxiety and its association with PA.
METHODS: Cross-sectional, community-based data from the World Health Survey was analyzed. Prevalence of anxiety was estimated for 237,964 individuals (47 countries). PA was categorized as low, moderate, and high based on the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (short form). The association between PA and anxiety was assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
RESULTS: The overall global prevalence of anxiety was 11.4% (47 countries). Across 38 countries with available data on PA, 62.5%, 20.2%, and 17.3% of the sample engaged in high, moderate, and low levels of PA respectively. The prevalence of low physical activity in those with and without anxiety was 22.9% vs. 16.6% (p<0.001) (38 countries, n=184,920). In the pooled model adjusted for socio-demographics, depression, and country, individuals engaging in low PA (vs. high PA) had 1.32 (95% CI=1.17-1.47) times higher odds for anxiety than those with high PA. Female sex, older age, lower education and wealth, and depression were also associated with low PA. At the individual country level, there was a significant positive association between low PA and anxiety in 17 of the 38 countries.
CONCLUSION: Low PA levels are associated with increased prevalence of anxiety. There is a need for longitudinal research to establish the directionality of the relationships observed.","BS receives funding from National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research &amp; Care Funding scheme.

The current meta-analysis aimed to (i) describe the pooled prevalence of T2DM in people with alcohol use disorders (AUDs), (ii) investigate the impact of demographic, clinical and treatment factors, and (iii) compare T2DM prevalences in AUDs versus the general population. The trim and fill adjusted pooled T2DM prevalence among 3998 people with AUDs (age range 34.8-51.1 years; 76.6% male) (N studies=7) was 12.4% (95%CI=11.8-13.9%). Higher T2DM prevalences were observed in studies with a higher mean age and a higher percentage of male participants, and in studies with self- or physician reported T2DM assessment. A trend for higher T2DM prevalences was found in inpatient settings, in studies assessing T2DM with the gold-standard oral glucose tolerance test compared with fasting glucose only, and with studies including patients with a higher percentage of physical co-morbidity. Although healthy control data are lacking, the pooled prevalence is similar to that observed in people with severe mental illness who are considered a high-risk group. Routine screening and multidisciplinary management of T2DM in people with AUDs is needed.","The authors wish to thank Dr. J.

A paucity of nationally representative studies investigating this relationship exists, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study explored the global association of PA with depression and its mediating factors.
METHOD: Participants from 36 LMICs from the World Health Survey were included. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were undertaken exploring the relationship between PA and depression.
RESULTS: Across 178 867 people (mean ± SD age = 36.2 ± 13.5 years; 49.9% male), the prevalence of depression and the prevalence of low PA were 6.6% and 16.8% respectively. The prevalence of low PA was significantly higher among those with depression vs. no depression (26.0% vs. 15.8%, P < 0.0001). In the adjusted model, depression was associated with higher odds for low PA (OR = 1.42; 95% CI = 1.24-1.63). Mediation analyses demonstrated that low PA among people with depression was explained by mobility limitations (40.3%), pain and discomfort (35.8%), disruptions in sleep and energy (25.2%), cognition (19.4%) and vision (10.9%).
CONCLUSION: Individuals with depression engage in lower levels of PA in LMICs. Future longitudinal research is warranted to better understand the relationships observed.","BS receives funding from the National Institute for Health Research Collaboration for Leadership in Applied Health Research &amp; Care Funding scheme.
