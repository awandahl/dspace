Both inflammatory and regulatory cytokine responses to malaria are blunted with increasing age in highly exposed children	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Cytokines; Malaria; Tolerance; Immunity; Age	PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; TUMOR-NECROSIS-FACTOR; NEONATAL DENDRITIC CELLS; INNATE IMMUNE-RESPONSES; CD4(+) T-CELLS; TRANSMISSION INTENSITY; TOLERANCE; ANTIBODIES; ASSOCIATION; COINFECTION	Background: Young children are at greatest risk for malaria-associated morbidity and mortality. The immune response of young children differs in fundamental ways from that of adults, and these differences likely contribute to the increased susceptibility of children to severe malaria and to their delayed development of immunity. Elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the peripheral blood during acute infection contribute to the control of parasitaemia, but are also responsible for much of the immunopathology seen during symptomatic disease. Clinical immunity to malaria may depend upon the ability to regulate these pro-inflammatory responses, possibly through mechanisms of immunologic tolerance. In order to explore the effect of age on the immune response to malaria and the development of clinical immunity, cytokines and chemokines were measured in the plasma of children at day 0 of an acute malaria episode and during convalescence. Results: Younger children presenting with acute malaria exhibited much higher levels of TNF, IL2, and IL6, as well as increased Th1 associated chemokines IP10, MIG, and MCP1, compared to older children with acute malaria. Additionally, the regulatory cytokines IL10 and TNFRI were dramatically elevated in younger children compared to older children during acute infection, indicating that regulatory as well as pro-inflammatory cytokine responses are dampened in later childhood. Conclusions: Together these data suggest that there is a profound blunting of the cytokine and chemokine response to malaria among older children residing in endemic settings, which may be due to repeated malaria exposure, intrinsic age-based differences in the immune response, or both.

Adequate treatment requires initial parenteral therapy for fast parasite clearance followed by longer acting oral antimalarial drugs for cure and prevention of recrudescence. Methods: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, we evaluated the 42-day parasitological outcomes of severe malaria treatment with intravenous artesunate (AS) or intravenous quinine (QNN) followed by oral artemisinin based combination therapy (ACT) in children living in a high malaria transmission setting in Eastern Uganda. Results: We enrolled 300 participants and all were included in the intention to treat analysis. Baseline characteristics were similar across treatment arms. The median and interquartile range for number of days from baseline to parasite clearance was significantly lower among participants who received intravenous AS (2 (1-2) vs 3 (2-3), P < 0. 001). Overall, 63.3% (178/281) of the participants had unadjusted parasitological treatment failure over the 42-day follow-up period. Molecular genotyping to distinguish re-infection from recrudescence was performed in a sample of 127 of the 178 participants, of whom majority 93 (73.2%) had re-infection and 34 (26.8%) had recrudescence. The 42 day risk of recrudescence did not differ with ACT administered. Adverse events were of mild to moderate severity and consistent with malaria symptoms. Conclusion: In this high transmission setting, we observed adequate initial treatment outcomes followed by very high rates of malaria re-infection post severe malaria treatment. The impact of recurrent antimalarial treatment on the long term efficacy of antimalarial regimens needs to be investigated and surveillance mechanisms for resistance markers established since recurrent malaria infections are likely to be exposed to sub-therapeutic drug concentrations. More strategies for prevention of recurrent malaria infections in the most at risk populations are needed.

Implementation research (IR) has the promise of supporting scale-up through enabling rapid learning about the intervention and its fit with the context in which it is implemented. We integrate conceptual frameworks addressing different dimensions of scaling up (specifically, the attributes of the service or innovation being scaled, the actors involved, the context, and the scale-up strategy) and questions commonly addressed by IR (concerning acceptability, appropriateness, adoption, feasibility, fidelity to original design, implementation costs, coverage and sustainability) to explore how IR can support scale-up. Methods: We draw upon three IR studies conducted by Future Health Systems (FHS) in Afghanistan, Bangladesh and Uganda. We reviewed project documents from the period 2011-2016 to identify information related, to the dimensions of scaling up. Further, for each country, we developed rich descriptions of how the research teams approached scaling up, and how IR contributed to scale-up. The rich descriptions were checked by FHS research teams. We identified common patterns and. differences across the three cases. Results: The three cases planned quite different innovations/interventions and had very different types of scale-up strategies. In all three cases, the research teams had extensive prior experience within the study communities, and. little explicit attention was paid, to contextual factors. All three cases involved complex interactions between the research teams and other stakeholders, among stakeholders, and between stakeholders and the intervention. The IR planned by the research teams focussed primarily on feasibility and effectiveness, but in practice, the research teams also had critical insights into other factors such as sustainability, acceptability, cost-effectiveness and appropriateness. Stakeholder analyses and other project management tools further complemented IR. Conclusions: IR can provide significant insights into how best to scale-up a particular intervention. To take advantage of insights from IR, scale-up strategies require flexibility and IR must also be sufficiently flexible to respond to new emerging questions. While commonly used conceptual frameworks for scale-up clearly delineate actors, such as implementers, target communities and the support team, in our experience, IR blurred the links between these groups.

We document the experience of Future Health Systems (FHS) Consortium research teams in Bangladesh, India and Uganda with using ToC. We seek to understand how and why ToCs were applied and to clarify how they facilitate the implementation of iterative intervention designs and stakeholder engagement in health systems research and strengthening. Methods: This paper combines literature on ToC, with a summary of reflections by FHS research members on the motivation, development, revision and use of the ToC, as well as on the benefits and challenges of the process. We describe three FHS teams' experiences along four potential uses of ToCs, namely planning, communication, learning and. accountability. Results: The three teams developed ToCs for planning and. evaluation purposes as required for their initial plans for FHS in 2011 and. revised, them half-way through the project, based on assumptions informed, by and adjusted, through the teams' experiences during the previous 2 years of implementation. All teams found that the revised ToCs and their accompanying narratives recognised greater feedback among intervention components and among key stakeholders. The ToC development and. revision fostered, channels for both internal and external communication, among research team members and. with key stakeholders, respectively. The process of revising the ToCs challenged the teams' initial assumptions based on new evidence and experience. In contrast, the ToCs were only minimally used for accountability purposes. Conclusions: The ToC development and revision process helped FHS research teams, and occasionally key local stakeholders, to reflect on and make their assumptions and mental models about their respective interventions explicit. Other projects using the ToC should allow time for revising and reflecting upon the ToCs, to recognise and document the adaptive nature of health systems, and to foster the time, space and flexibility that health systems strengthening programmes must have to learn from implementation and stakeholder engagement.

This limits opportunities for strengthening local health managers' capacity, improving resource utilisation and. enhancing service delivery. This study explored the contribution of a participatory action research approach to strengthening health managers' capacity in Eastern Uganda. Methods: This was a qualitative study that used, open-ended key informant interviews, combined, with review of meeting minutes and observations to collect data. Both inductive and. deductive thematic analysis was undertaken. The Competing Values Framework of organisational management functions guided the deductive process of analysis and the interpretation of the findings. The framework builds on four earlier models of management and regards them as complementary rather than conflicting, and identifies four managers' capacities (collaborate, create, compete and control) by categorising them along two axes, one contrasting flexibility versus control and the other internal versus external organisational focus. Results: The findings indicate that the participatory action research approach enhanced health managers' capacity to collaborate with others, be creative, attain goals and review progress. The enablers included expanded interaction spaces, encouragement of flexibility, empowerment of local managers, and the promotion of reflection and. accountability. Tension and conflict across different management functions was apparent; for example, while there was a need to collaborate, maintaining control over processes was also needed. These tensions meant that managers needed to learn to simultaneously draw upon and use different capacities as reflected by the Competing Values Framework in order to maximise their effectiveness. Conclusions: Improved health manager capacity is essential if sustained, improvements in health outcomes in low-income countries are to be attained. The expansion of interaction spaces, encouragement of flexibility, empowerment of local managers, and the promotion of reflection and accountability were the key means by which participatory action research strengthened health managers' capacity. The participatory approach to implementation therefore created opportunities to strengthen health managers' capacity.

A varied number of tools have been employed for stakeholder engagement. In this paper, we discuss two participatory methods for engaging with [stakeholders - participatory social network analysis (PSNA) and participatoiy impact pathways analysis (PIPA). Based on I our experience, we derive lessons about when and how to apply these tools. Methods: This paper was informed by a review of project reports and documents in addition to reflection meetings I with the researchers who applied the tools. These reports were synthesised and used to make thick descriptions of the applications of the methods while highlighting key lessons. Results: PSNA and PIPA both allowed a deep understanding of how the system actors are interconnected and how they influence maternal health and maternal healthcare services. The findings from the PSNA provided guidance on how stakeholders of a health system are interconnected and how they can stimulate more positive interaction between the stakeholders by exposing existing gaps. The PIPA meeting enabled the participants to envision how they could expand their networks and resources by mentally thinking about the contributions that they could make to the project. The processes that were considered critical for successful application of the tools and achievement of outcomes included training of facilitators, language used during the facilitation, the number of times the tool is applied, length of the tools, pretesting of the tools, and use of quantitative and qualitative methods. Conclusions: Whereas both tools allowed the identification of stakeholders and provided a deeper understanding of the type of networks and dynamics within the network PIPA had a higher potential for promoting collaboration between stakeholders, likely due to allowing interaction between them. Additionally, it was implemented within a participatory action research project. PIPA also allowed participatoiy evaluation of the project from the perspective of the community.

Participatory monitoring and evalution approaches that influence decision-making: lessons from a maternal and newborn study in Eastern Uganda	HEALTH RESEARCH POLICY AND SYSTEMS			English	Article						Participatory monitoring and evaluation; Implementation research; Maternal and newborn health; Decision-making; Stakeholders	COMPLEX INTERVENTIONS; MENTAL-HEALTH; FACILITATORS; BARRIERS; CARE	Background: The use of participatory monitoring and evaluation (M&E) approaches is important for guiding local decision-making, promoting the implementation of effective interventions and addressing emerging issues in the course of implementation. In this article, we explore how participatory M&E approaches helped to identify key design and implementation issues and how they influenced stakeholders' decision-making in eastern Uganda. Method: The data for this paper is drawn from a retrospective reflection of various M&E approaches used in a materna ! and newborn health project that was implemented in three districts in eastern Uganda. The methods included qualitative and quantitative M&E techniques such as key informant interviews, forma ! surveys and supportive supervision, as well as participatory approaches, notably participatory impact pathway analysis. Results: At the design stage, the M&E approaches were useful for identifying key local problems and feasible local solutions and informing the activities that were subsequently implemented. During the implementation phase, the M&E approaches provided evidence that informed decision-making and helped identify emerging issues, such as weak implementation by some village health teams, health facility constraints such as poor use of standard guidelines, lack of placenta disposal pits, inadequate fuel for the ambulance at some facilities, and poor care for low birth weight infants. Sharing this information with key stakeholders prompted them to take appropriate actions. For example, the sub-county leadership constructed placenta disposal pits, the district health officer provided fuel for ambulances, and health workers received refresher training and mentorship on how to care for newborns. Conclusion: Diverse sources of information and perspectives can help researchers and decision-makers understand and adapt evidence to contexts for more effective interventions. Supporting districts to have crosscutting, routine information generating and sharing platforms that bring together stakeholders from different sectors is therefore crucial for the successful implementation of complex development interventions.

There remain complex challenges to the global elimination of paediatric HIV-1 infection. Thus, for the global community to achieve elimination of new paediatric HIV-1 infections, innovative approaches need to be explored. Immune-based approaches to prevention of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) may help fill some of the remaining gaps and provide new opportunities to achieve an AIDS-free generation. Immune-based interventions to prevent MTCT of HIV-1 may include paediatric HIV vaccines and passive immunization approaches. Recent discoveries providing evidence of robust immune responses to HIV in infants open new and exciting prospects for paediatric HIV vaccines. Moreover, successful vaccination of infants has a different set of requirements than vaccination of adults and may be easier to achieve. Proof-of-concept has been established over the last two decades that passively administered HIV-1 Env-specific monoclonal antibody (mAbs) can prevent chimeric simian human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) transmission to newborn nonhuman primates. There has been tremendous progress in isolating and characterizing broadly neutralizing antibodies to HIV, and clinical testing of these antibodies for treatment and prevention in both infants and adults is a major effort in the field. Immune-based interventions need to be actively explored as they can provide critically important tools to address persistent challenges in MTCT prevention. It is a pivotal time for the field with active discussions on the best strategy to further reduce HIV infection of infants and accomplish the World Health Organization Fast-Track 2030 goals to eliminate new paediatric HIV infections.

We describe retention in care and factors associated with loss to follow-up (LTFU) among women initiated on Option B+ as part of an evaluation of the effectiveness of the national program. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of data abstracted from records of 2,169 women enrolled on Option B+ between January and March 2013 from a representative sample of 145 health facilities in all 24 districts of the Central region of Uganda. We defined retention as "being alive and receiving ART at the last clinic visit". We used Kaplan-Meier analysis to estimate retention in care and compared differences between women retained in care and those LTFU using the chi-squared test for dichotomized or categorical variables. Results The median follow-up time was 20.2 months (IQR 4.2-22.5). The proportion of women retained in HIV care at 6, 12 and 18 months post-ART initiation was 74.2%, 66.7% and 62.0%, respectively. Retention at 18 months varied significantly by level of health facility and ranged from 70.0% among those seen at hospitals to 56.6% among those seen at lower level health facilities. LTFU was higher among women aged less than 25 years, 59.3% compared to those aged 25 years and above, 40.7% (p = 0.02); among those attending care at lower level facilities, 44.0% compared to those attending care at hospitals, 34.1% (p = 0.01), and among those who were not tested for CD4 cell count at ART initiation, 69.4% compared to those who were tested, 30.9% (p = 0.002). Conclusion Retention of women who were initiated on Option B+ during the early phases of roll-out was only moderate, and could undermine the effectiveness of the program. Identifying reasons why women drop out and designing targeted interventions for improved retention should be a priority.

Objective: To determine the impact of an innovative multi-modal quality improvement program on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status assessment and the impact of HIV status on severe illness conditions and mortality. Design: This was a staggered, pre-post quasi-experimental study designed to assess a multi-modal intervention (collaborative improvement meetings, audit and feedback, clinical mentoring) for improving quality of care following formal training in the management of severe illness in low-income settings. Results: From August 2014 to May 2015, 5759 patients were hospitalized, of whom 2451 (42.6%) had their HIV status assessed; 395 (16.1%) were HIV-infected. HIV-infected patients were significantly more likely to meet criteria for shock (27.5% vs. 15.1%, risk ratio [RR] 1.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-1.9, P < 0.001) and severe respiratory distress (6.7% vs. 4.3%, RR 1.5, 95% CI 1.2-2.0, P < 0.001), and were significantly more likely to die in hospital (12.0% vs. 2.9%, RR 4.1, 95% CI 3.2-5.4, P < 0.001). There was no evidence of improved HIV status assessment during the intervention period (36.5% vs. 44.8%, +8.3%, 95% CI -8.3 to 24.8, P = 0.33). Conclusions: Hospitalized HIV-infected patients in western Uganda are at high risk for severe illness and death. Novel quality improvement strategies are needed to enhance hospital-based HIV testing in high-burden settings.	[Cummings, M.

Methodology for a mixed-methods multi-country study to assess recognition of and response to maternal and newborn illness	JOURNAL OF HEALTH POPULATION AND NUTRITION			English	Article						Maternal mortality; Newborn mortality; Developing country; Qualitative research; Care-seeking behavior	FORMATIVE RESEARCH INFORM; OBSTETRIC DANGER SIGNS; CARE-SEEKING PRACTICES; RURAL RAJASTHAN; HEALTH; PERCEPTIONS; PREGNANCY; KNOWLEDGE; BEHAVIOR; INTERVENTION	Background: Although maternal and newborn mortality have decreased 44 and 46% respectively between 1990 and 2015, achievement of ambitious Sustainable Development Goal targets requires accelerated progress. Mortality reduction requires a renewed focus on the continuum of maternal and newborn care from the household to the health facility. Although barriers to accessing skilled care are documented for specific contexts, there is a lack of systematic evidence on how women and families identify maternal and newborn illness and make decisions and subsequent care-seeking patterns. The focus of this multi-country study was to identify and describe illness recognition, decision-making, and care-seeking patterns across various contexts among women and newborns who survived and died to ultimately inform programmatic priorities moving forward. Methods: This study was conducted in seven countries-Ethiopia, Tanzania, Uganda, Nigeria, India, Indonesia, and Nepal. Mixed-methods were utilized including event narratives (group interviews), in-depth interviews (IDIs), focus group discussions (FDGs), rapid facility assessments, and secondary analyses of existing program data. A common protocol and tools were developed in collaboration with study teams and adapted for each site, as needed. Sample size was a minimum of five cases of each type (e.g., perceived postpartum hemorrhage, maternal death, newborn illness, and newborn death) for each study site, with a total of 84 perceived PPH, 45 maternal deaths, 83 newborn illness, 55 newborn deaths, 64 IDIs/FGDs, and 99 health facility assessments across all sites. Analysis included coding within and across cases, identifying broad themes on recognition of illness, decision-making, and patterns of care seeking, and corresponding contextual factors. Technical support was provided throughout the process for capacity building, quality assurance, and consistency across sites. Conclusion: This study provides rigorous evidence on how women and families recognize and respond to maternal and newborn illness. By using a common methodology and tools, findings not only were site-specific but also allow for comparison across contexts.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study using qualitative methods. We conducted 48 event narratives: eight maternal and newborn deaths and 16 maternal and newborn illnesses. Additionally, we conducted six FGDs with women's saving groups and community leaders. Qualitative data were analyzed thematically using Atlas.ti software. Results: Women and caretakers reported that community initiatives including the presence of community health workers and women's saving groups helped in enhancing illness recognition, decision-making, and care-seeking for maternal and newborn complications. Newborn illness seemed to be less well understood, and formal care was often delayed. Care-seeking was complicated by accessing several stations from primary to secondary care, and often, the hospital was reached too late. Conclusions: Our qualitative study suggests that community approaches may play a role in illness recognition, decision-making, and care-seeking for maternal and newborn illness. The role of primary facilities in providing care for maternal and newborn emergencies might need to be reviewed.

From 2010, there were efforts to improve childhood tuberculosis diagnosis in Kampala and this study aimed to document the trend and outcome of tuberculosis in children over the period. Methods: This was a retrospective study of tuberculosis data for Kampala city for the period 2011-2015. We extracted data from the unit TB registers in the 52 Diagnostic and treatment units (DTUs) in the Kampala. We report on data for children 0 to 14 years. Results: We accessed 33,221 TB patient records of which 2333 (7.0% 95% CI 6.7 to 7.3) were children. The proportion of children with pulmonary TB was 80% (1870/2333) (95% CI 76.7 to 83.7 and extra-pulmonary TB accounted for 20% (463/2333) (CI 18.3 to 21.5). Among pulmonary TB cases, the clinically diagnosed were 82% (1530/1870) (95% CI 80.0 to 83.5) while the bacteriologically confirmed were 18% (340/1870) (95% CI 16.5 to 20.0). Among the bacteriologically confirmed, 45% (154/340) (95% CI 40.1 to 50.6) were smear positive. During the study period 2011 through 2015, the childhood TB notification rate declined as follows; 105, 76, 72, 88, and 74 per 100,000 respectively. The treatment success rate increased from 78% in 2011 to 83% in 2015. Conclusions: The TB notification rate among children in Kampala city showed a large decline during the period 2011 to 2015. There was a slight improvement in the treatment success rate among the children.

Our aim was to estimate worldwide trends in mean body-mass index (BMI) and a comprehensive set of BMI categories that cover underweight to obesity in children and adolescents, and to compare trends with those of adults. Methods We pooled 2416 population-based studies with measurements of height and weight on 128.9 million participants aged 5 years and older, including 31.5 million aged 5-19 years. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to estimate trends from 1975 to 2016 in 200 countries for mean BMI and for prevalence of BMI in the following categories for children and adolescents aged 5-19 years: more than 2 SD below the median of the WHO growth reference for children and adolescents (referred to as moderate and severe underweight hereafter), 2 SD to more than 1 SD below the median (mild underweight), 1 SD below the median to 1 SD above the median (healthy weight), more than 1 SD to 2 SD above the median (overweight but not obese), and more than 2 SD above the median (obesity). Findings Regional change in age-standardised mean BMI in girls from 1975 to 2016 ranged from virtually no change (-0.01 kg/m (2) per decade; 95% credible interval -0.42 to 0.39, posterior probability [PP] of the observed decrease being a true decrease= 0.5098) in eastern Europe to an increase of 1.00 kg/m(2) per decade (0.69-1.35, PP> 0.9999) in central Latin America and an increase of 0.95 kg/m (2) per decade (0.64-1.25, PP> 0.9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. The range for boys was from a non-significant increase of 0.09 kg/m(2) per decade (-0.33 to 0.49, PP= 0.6926) in eastern Europe to an increase of 0.77 kg/m (2) per decade (0.50-1.06, PP> 0.9999) in Polynesia and Micronesia. Trends in mean BMI have recently flattened in northwestern Europe and the high-income English-speaking and Asia-Pacific regions for both sexes, southwestern Europe for boys, and central and Andean Latin America for girls. By contrast, the rise in BMI has accelerated in east and south Asia for both sexes, and southeast Asia for boys. Global age-standardised prevalence of obesity increased from 0.7% (0.4-1.2) in 1975 to 5.6% (4.8-6.5) in 2016 in girls, and from 0.9% (0.5-1.3) in 1975 to 7.8% (6.7-9.1) in 2016 in boys; the prevalence of moderate and severe underweight decreased from 9.2% (6.0-12.9) in 1975 to 8.4% (6.8-10.1) in 2016 in girls and from 14.8% (10.4-19.5) in 1975 to 12.4% (10.3-14.5) in 2016 in boys. Prevalence of moderate and severe underweight was highest in India, at 22.7% (16.7-29.6) among girls and 30.7% (23.5-38.0) among boys. Prevalence of obesity was more than 30% in girls in Nauru, the Cook Islands, and Palau; and boys in the Cook Islands, Nauru, Palau, Niue, and American Samoa in 2016. Prevalence of obesity was about 20% or more in several countries in Polynesia and Micronesia, the Middle East and north Africa, the Caribbean, and the USA. In 2016, 75 (44-117) million girls and 117 (70-178) million boys worldwide were moderately or severely underweight. In the same year, 50 (24-89) million girls and 74 (39-125) million boys worldwide were obese. Interpretation The rising trends in children's and adolescents' BMI have plateaued in many high-income countries, albeit at high levels, but have accelerated in parts of Asia, with trends no longer correlated with those of adults.

Objective: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Methods: We conducted a survey in 2016 of 930 children under the age of 2 years in Lira district, northern Uganda. Mothers of the children were interviewed and data was collected on mobile phones using Open Data Kit software (https://opendatakit.org). Multivariable logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Results: Almost half [48.2%, 95% confidence interval (CI) (44.3-52.1)] of the mothers delayed initiation of breastfeeding. Factors significantly associated with delayed initiation of breastfeeding in multivariable analysis included caesarean delivery [Adjusted Odds Ratio (AOR) 11.10 95% CI (3.73-33.04)], discarding initial breast milk [AOR 2.02 95% CI (1.41-2.88)], home delivery [AOR 1.43 95% CI (1.04-1.97)] and mother being responsible for initiating breastfeeding as compared to a health worker or relative [AOR 1.73 95% CI (1.33-2.26)]. Mothers having a secondary education were less likely [AOR 0.54 95% CI (0.30-0.96)] to delay initiation of breastfeeding as compared to those with no education. Conclusion: About half the mothers delayed initiation of breastfeeding until after 1 hour after birth. Programs to promote, protect and support breastfeeding in this post conflict region are urgently needed.

Inhibition of merozoite invasion and transient de-sequestration by sevuparin in humans with Plasmodium falciparum malaria	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MEMBRANE PROTEIN-1 PFEMP1; HEPARIN; ERYTHROCYTES; ROSETTES; ANTIBODY; LIGAND	Severe malaria Even with the best available treatment, the mortality from severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains high. Typical features at death are high parasite loads and obstructed micro-vasculature. Infected erythrocytes (IE) containing mature parasites bind to the host receptor heparan sulfate, which is also an important receptor for merozoite invasion. To block merozoite invasion has not previously been proposed as an adjunctive therapeutic approach but it may preclude the early expansion of an infection that else leads to exacerbated sequestration and death. Sevuparin in phase I study The drug sevuparin was developed from heparin because heparan sulfate and heparin are nearly identical, so the rationale was that sevuparin would act as a decoy receptor during malaria infection. A phase I study was performed in healthy male volunteers and sevuparin was found safe and well tolerated. Sevuparin in phase I/II clinical study A phase I/II clinical study was performed in which sevuparin was administered via short intravenous infusions to malaria patients with uncomplicated malaria who were also receiving atovaquone/proguanil treatment. This was a Phase I/II, randomized, open label, active control, parallel assignment study. Sevuparin was safe and well tolerated in the malaria patients. The mean relative numbers of ring-stage IEs decreased after a single sevuparin infusion and mature parasite IEs appeared transiently in the circulation. The effects observed on numbers of merozoites and throphozoites in the circulation, were detected already one hour after the first sevuparin injection. Here we report the development of a candidate drug named sevuparin that both blocks merozoite invasion and transiently de-sequesters IE in humans with P. falciparum malaria.

A total of 15 virus-selective samples were collected at five sites (Bugolobi Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) influent and effluent, Nakivubo Channel upstream and downstream of the WWTP, and Nakivubo Swamp) in July and August 2016. Quantitative PCR and quantitative RT-PCR was performed to determine the concentrations of four human viruses (adenovirus, enterovirus, rotavirus, and hepatitis A virus) in the samples. Adenovirus (1.53*10(5)-1.98*10(7) copies/L) and enterovirus (3.17*10(5)-8.13*10(7) copies/ L) were found to have the highest concentrations in the samples compared to rotavirus (5.79*10(1)-3.77*10(3) copies/L) and hepatitis A virus (9.93*10(2)-1.11*10(4) copies/L). In addition, next-generation sequencing and metagenomic analyses were performed to assess viral diversity, and several human and vertebrate viruses were detected, including Herpesvirales, Iridoviridae, Poxviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Bunyaviridae and others. Effluent from the wastewater treatment plant appears to impact surface water, as samples taken from surface water downstream of the treatment plant had higher viral concentrations than samples taken upstream. Temporal fluctuations in viral abundance and diversity were also observed. Continuous monitoring of wastewater may contribute to assessing viral disease patterns at a population level and provide early warning of potential outbreaks using wastewater-based epidemiology methods.

Recent evidence demonstrated improved birth outcomes among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-uninfected pregnant women protected by indoor residual spraying of insecticide (IRS). Evidence regarding its impact on HIV-infected pregnant women is lacking. Methods. Data were pooled from 2 studies conducted before and after an IRS campaign in Tororo, Uganda, among HIV-infected pregnant women who received bed nets, daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and combination antiretroviral therapy at enrollment. Exposure was the proportion of pregnancy protected by IRS. Adverse birth outcomes included preterm birth, low birth weight, and fetal or neonatal death. Multivariate Poisson regression with robust standard errors was used to estimate risk ratios. Results. Of 565 women in our analysis, 380 (67%), 88 (16%), and 97 (17%) women were protected by IRS for 0%, > 0% to 90%, and > 90% of their pregnancy, respectively. Any IRS protection significantly reduced malaria incidence during pregnancy and placental malaria risk. Compared with no IRS protection, > 90% IRS protection reduced preterm birth risk (risk ratio, 0.35; 95% confidence interval,.15-.84), with nonsignificant decreases in the risk of low birth weight (0.68;.29-1.57) and fetal or neonatal death (0.24;.04-1.52). Discussion. Our exploratory analyses support the hypothesis that IRS may significantly reduce malaria and preterm birth risk among pregnant women with HIV receiving bed nets, daily trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and combination antiretroviral therapy.

Socioeconomic position and ten-year survival and virologic outcomes in a Ugandan HIV cohort receiving antiretroviral therapy	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; FUNDAMENTAL CAUSES; VIRAL SUPPRESSION; SOUTH-AFRICA; MORTALITY; PROGRAM; CARE; POPULATION; INFECTION; DETERMINANTS	Lifelong ART is essential to reducing HIV mortality and ending the epidemic, however the interplay between socioeconomic position and long-term outcomes of HIV-infected persons receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown. Furthering the understanding of factors related to long-term ART outcomes in this important region will aid the successful scale-up of ART programs. We enrolled 559 HIV-infected Ugandan adults starting ART in 2004-2005 at the Infectious Diseases Institute in Kampala, Uganda and followed them for 10 years. We documented baseline employment status, regular household income, education level, housing description, physical ability, and CD4 count. Viral load was measured every six months. Proportional hazard regression tested for associations between baseline characteristics and 1) mortality, 2) virologic failure, and 3) mortality or virologic failure as a composite outcome. Over ten years 23% (n = 127) of participants died, 6% (n = 31) were lost-to-follow-up and 23% (107/472) experienced virologic treatment failure. In Kaplan-Meier analysis we observed an association between employment and mortality, with the highest cumulative probability of death occurring in unemployed individuals. In univariate analysis unemployment and disease severity were associated with mortality, but in multivariable analysis the only association with mortality was disease severity. We observed an association between higher household income and an increased incidence of both virologic failure and the combined outcome, and an association between self-employment and lower incidence of virologic failure and the combined outcome when compared to unemployment. Formal education level and housing status were unrelated to outcomes. It is feasible to achieve good ten-year survival, retention-in-care, and viral suppression in a socioeconomically diverse population in a resource-limited setting. Unemployment appears to be related to adverse 10-year ART outcomes. A low level of formal education does not appear to be a barrier to successful long-term ART.

Cost-effectiveness analysis of introducing malaria diagnostic testing in drug shops: A cluster-randomised trial in Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							EFFECTIVENESS ACCEPTABILITY CURVES; TREATING UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA; HEALTH FACILITIES; COMBINATION THERAPY; CAMEROON; RETAILERS	Background Private sector drug shops are an important source of malaria treatment in Africa, yet diagnosis without parasitological testing is common among these providers. Accurate rapid diagnostic tests for malaria (mRDTs) require limited training and present an opportunity to increase access to correct diagnosis. The present study was a cost-effectiveness analysis of the introduction of mRDTs in Ugandan drug shops. Methods Drug shop vendors were trained to perform and sell subsidised mRDTs and artemisininbased combination therapies (ACTs) in the intervention arm while vendors offered ACTs following presumptive diagnosis of malaria in the control arm. The effect on the proportion of customers with fever 'appropriately treated of malaria with ACT' was captured during a randomised trial in drug shops in Mukono District, Uganda. Health sector costs included: training of drug shop vendors, community sensitisation, supervision and provision of mRDTs and ACTs to drug shops. Household costs of treatment-seeking were captured in a representative sample of drug shop customers. Findings The introduction of mRDTs in drug shops was associated with a large improvement of diagnosis and treatment of malaria, resulting in low incremental costs for the health sector at US $0.55 per patient appropriately treated of malaria. High expenditure on non-ACT drugs by households contributed to higher incremental societal costs of US$3.83. Sensitivity analysis showed that mRDTs would become less cost-effective compared to presumptive diagnosis with increasing malaria prevalence and lower adherence to negative mRDT results. Conclusion mRDTs in drug shops improved the targeting of ACTs to malaria patients and are likely to be considered cost-effective compared to presumptive diagnosis, although the increased costs borne by households when the test result is negative are a concern.

At the heart of the conference rested a common commitment to see patient care improved across Uganda and the region. The theme-United Against Cancer: Prevention to End-of-Life Care-reflected this joint vision and the drive to remember that cancer care should include prevention, early diagnosis and screening, treatment, rehabilitation and palliative care. The conference brought together 451 delegates from 17 countries. The key themes of the conference included: the importance of the World Health Assembly Resolutions on Palliative Care (2014) and cancer care (2017); the need to develop a National Cancer Control Programme; strategies for effective cancer diagnosis and treatment in low-and middle-income countries; advocacy, human rights and access to essential medicines, including access to opioids and nurse prescribing; paediatric care; leadership and commitment; collaboration; resources (financial and human), the recognition that palliative care is not limited to cancer care and the importance of learning from each other. The conference also gave the opportunity to celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the UCI, with a celebration dinner attended by the Minister of Health and the US Ambassador. Participants reported that the conference was a forum that updated them in all aspects of cancer and palliative care, which challenged their knowledge, and was enlightening in terms of current treatment options for individuals with cancer. The benefits of having a joint conference were recognised, allowing for further networking between cancer and palliative care organisations. This conference, highlighting many developments in cancer and palliative care, served as a unique opportunity to bring people together and unite them in developing cancer and palliative care.

Novel use Of Hydroxyurea in an African Region with Malaria (NOHARM): a trial for children with sickle cell anemia	BLOOD			English	Article							NITRIC-OXIDE; GENE-EXPRESSION; DISEASE; HYDROXYCARBAMIDE; MULTICENTER; PROTECTION; MORBIDITY; MORTALITY; SEVERITY; ADHESION	Hydroxyurea treatment is recommended for children with sickle cell anemia (SCA) living in high-resource malaria-free regions, but its safety and efficacy in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa, where the greatest sickle-cell burden exists, remain unknown. In vitro studies suggest hydroxyurea could increase malaria severity, and hydroxyurea-associated neutropenia could worsen infections. NOHARM (Novel use Of Hydroxyurea in an African Region with Malaria) was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial conducted in malaria-endemic Uganda, comparing hydroxyurea to placebo at 20 +/- 2.5mg/kg per day for 12 months. The primary outcome was incidence of clinical malaria. Secondary outcomes included SCA-related adverse events (AEs), clinical and laboratory effects, and hematological toxicities. Children received either hydroxyurea (N = 104) or placebo (N = 103). Malaria incidence did not differ between children on hydroxyurea (0.05 episodes per child per year; 95% confidence interval [0.02, 0.13]) vs placebo (0.07 episodes per child per year [0.03, 0.16]); the hydroxyurea/placebo malaria incidence rate ratio was 0.7 ([0.2, 2.7]; P = .61). Time to infection also did not differ significantly between treatment arms. A composite SCA-related clinical outcome (vaso-occlusive painful crisis, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, or blood transfusion) was less frequent with hydroxyurea (45%) than placebo (69%; P = .001). Children receiving hydroxyurea had significantly increased hemoglobin concentration and fetal hemoglobin, with decreased leukocytes and reticulocytes. Serious AEs, sepsis episodes, and dose-limiting toxicities were similar between treatment arms. Three deaths occurred (2 hydroxyurea, 1 placebo, and none from malaria). Hydroxyurea treatment appears safe for children with SCA living in malaria-endemic sub-Saharan Africa, without increased severe malaria, infections, or AEs. Hydroxyurea provides SCA-related laboratory and clinical efficacy, but optimal dosing and monitoring regimens for Africa remain undefined.

Exploring knowledge and attitudes toward non-communicable diseases among village health teams in Eastern Uganda: a cross-sectional study	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						community health workers; Village health teams; Non-communicable diseases; Uganda; Task-shifting; Community engagement; Health systems	SOUTH-AFRICA; RISK-FACTORS; WORKERS; CARE; PREVALENCE; SERVICES	Background: Community health workers are essential personnel in resource-limited settings. In Uganda, they are organized into Village Health Teams (VHTs) and are focused on infectious diseases and maternal-child health; however, their skills could potentially be utilized in national efforts to reduce the growing burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). We sought to assess the knowledge of, and attitudes toward NCDs and NCD care among VHTs in Uganda as a step toward identifying their potential role in community NCD prevention and management. Methods: We administered a knowledge, attitudes and practices questionnaire to 68 VHT members from Iganga and Mayuge districts in Eastern Uganda. In addition, we conducted four focus group discussions with 33 VHT members. Discussions focused on NCD knowledge and facilitators of and barriers to incorporating NCD prevention and care into their role. A thematic qualitative analysis was conducted to identify salient themes in the data. Results: VHT members possessed some knowledge and awareness of NCDs but identified a lack of knowledge about NCDs in the communities they served. They were enthusiastic about incorporating NCD care into their role and thought that they could serve as effective conduits of knowledge about NCDs to their communities if empowered through NCD education, the availability of proper reporting and referral tools, and visible collaborations with medical personnel. The lack of financial remuneration for their role did not emerge as a major barrier to providing NCD services. Conclusions: Ugandan VHTs saw themselves as having the potential to play an important role in improving community awareness of NCDs as well as monitoring and referral of community members for NCD-related health issues. In order to accomplish this, they anticipated requiring context-specific and culturally adapted training as well as strong partnerships with facility-based medical personnel. A lack of financial incentivization was not identified to be a major barrier to such role expansion. Developing a role for VHTs in NCD prevention and management should be a key consideration as local and national NCD initiatives are developed.

The reasons for this have not been established in Makarfi, Nigeria, despite the high burden of malaria in the area. A study was conducted among caregivers of febrile children less than 5 years presenting for treatment to understand their awareness of malaria diagnostic testing and being offered testing by clinicians, the determinants of these outcomes, and caregivers' perspectives of health workers' testing practices. Methods: Using mixed-methods, data was combined from sub-analysis of cross-sectional survey data (n = 295) and focus group discussions (n = 4) with caregivers conducted in Makarfi General Hospital (Kaduna State, Nigeria) and surrounding communities in 2011. Bivariate and multivariate analysis of the quantitative survey data was conducted to examine associations of caregivers' sociodemographic characteristics with testing awareness and having ever been offered testing. Transcripts from focus group discussions (FGD) were analysed for emerging themes related to caregivers' perspectives on malaria testing. Results: Among surveyed caregivers who were predominantly female (81.7%), not formally educated (72.5%), and were housewives (68.8%); only 5.3% were aware of any diagnostic testing for malaria, and only 4.3% had ever been offered a malaria test by a health worker. Having at least a primary level education (adjusted odds ratio [ aOR] 20.3, 95% CI 4.5-92.1) and living within 5 km of the hospital (aOR 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-12.5) were determinants of awareness of malaria testing. Also, these were determinants of previously having been offered a test (aOR 9.9, 95% CI 2.1-48.7; and aOR 4.0, 95% CI 1.1-14.7). FGD showed many caregivers believed that malaria testing was for severe illness only, and that proximity to a health facility and cost of treatment influenced the seeking and receiving of care. Conclusions: Uptake of malaria testing prior to treatment can be improved by increasing its awareness and addressing misunderstandings among caregivers, promoting testing practices among health workers, and availing caregivers living farther from health centres alternative opportunities for community case management of febrile illnesses.

In Uganda, we lack contemporary data about the availability, cost and affordability of medicines and diagnostic tests essential in asthma and COPD management. Methods: Data on the availability, cost and affordability of 17 medicines and 2 diagnostic tests essential in asthma and COPD management were collected from 22 public hospitals, 23 private and 85 private pharmacies. The percentage of the available medicines and diagnostic tests, the median retail price of the lowest priced generic brand and affordability in terms of the number of days' wages it would cost the least paid public servant were analysed. Results: The availability of inhaled short acting beta agonists (SABA), oral leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRA), inhaled LABA-ICS combinations and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in all the study sites was 75%, 60.8%, 46.9% and 45.4% respectively. None of the study sites had inhaled long acting anti muscarinic agents (LAMA) and inhaled long acting beta agonist (LABA)-LAMA combinations. Spirometry and peak flow-metry as diagnostic tests were available in 24.4% and 6.7% of the study sites respectively. Affordability ranged from 2.2 days' wages for inhaled salbutamol to 17.1 days' wages for formoterol/budesonide inhalers and 27.8 days' wages for spirometry. Conclusion: Medicines and diagnostic tests essential in asthma and COPD care are not widely available in Uganda and remain largely unaffordable. Strategies to improve access to affordable asthma and COPD medicines and diagnostic tests should be implemented in Uganda.

The design and implementation of PHIs assumes a linear KAP relationship, i.e., an awareness campaign results in the desirable societal behavioral change. However, there is no robust framework for testing this relationship before and after PHIs. Here, we use qualitative and quantitative data on pesticide usage to test this linear relationship, identify associated context specific factors as well as assemble a framework that could be used to guide and evaluate PHIs. We used data from a cross-sectional mixed methods study on pesticide usage. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire from 167 households representing 1,002 individuals. Qualitative data were collected from key informants and focus group discussions. Quantitative and qualitative data analysis was done in R 3.2.0 as well as qualitative thematic analysis, respectively. Our framework shows that a KAP linear relationship only existed for households with a low knowledge score, suggesting that an awareness campaign would only be effective for similar to 37% of the households. Context specific socioeconomic factors explain why this relationship does not hold for households with high knowledge scores. These findings are essential for developing targeted cost-effective and sustainable interventions on pesticide usage and other PHIs with context specific modifications.

The objective of this systematic review is to determine the most common etiologies of non-traumatic myelopathy in sub-Saharan Africa to inform a regionally appropriate diagnostic algorithm. Methods: We conducted a systemic review searching Medline and Embase databases using the following search terms: "Non traumatic spinal cord injury" or "myelopathy" with limitations to epidemiology or etiologies and Sub-Saharan Africa. We described the frequencies of the different etiologies and proposed a diagnostic algorithm based on the most common diagnoses. Results: We identified 19 studies all performed at tertiary institutions; 15 were retrospective and 13 were published in the era of the HIV epidemic. Compressive bone lesions accounted for more than 48% of the cases; a majority were Pott's disease and metastatic disease. No diagnosis was identified in up to 30% of cases in most studies; in particular, definitive diagnoses of non-compressive lesions were rare and a majority were clinical diagnoses of transverse myelitis and HIV myelopathy. Age and HIV were major determinants of etiology. Conclusion: Compressive myelopathies represent a majority of non-traumatic myelopathies in sub-Saharan Africa, and most were due to Pott's disease. Non-compressive myelopathies have not been well defined and need further research in Africa. We recommend a standardized approach to management of non-traumatic myelopathy focused on identifying treatable conditions with tests widely available in low-resource settings.

Redemption of the "spoiled identity:" the role of HIV-positive individuals in HIV care cascade interventions	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						HIV-infected adults; HIV-related stigma; therapeutic citizenship; HIV care cascade; HIV care continuum; sub-Saharan Africa	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; CITIZENSHIP; ADHERENCE; AFRICA; PREVENTION; ENGAGEMENT; HIV/AIDS; WORKERS; AIDS	Introduction: The concept of "therapeutic citizenship" has drawn attention to ways in which public testimony, the "story-telling in the public sphere" undertaken by people living with HIV (PLHIV), has shaped the global response to the epidemic. This paper presents qualitative findings from two large studies in eastern Africa that reveal how the advent of population-based HIV testing campaigns and efforts to accelerate antiretroviral "treatment for all" has precipitated a rapidly expanding therapeutic citizenship "project," or social movement. The title of this paper refers to Goffman's original conceptualization of stigma as a social process through which a person's identity is rendered "spoiled." Methods: Data were derived from qualitative studies embedded within two clinical trials, Sustainable East African Research in Community Health (SEARCH) (NCT# 01864603) in Kenya and Uganda, and START-ART (NCT# 01810289) in Uganda, which aimed to offer insights into the pathways through which outcomes across the HIV care continuum can be achieved by interventions deployed in the studies, any unanticipated consequences, and factors that influenced implementation. Qualitative indepth semi-structured interviews were conducted among cohorts of adults in 2014 through 2015; across both studies and time periods, 217 interviews were conducted with 166 individuals. Theoretically informed, team-based analytic approaches were used for the analyses. Results: Narratives from PLHIV, who have not always been conceptualized as actors but rather usually as targets of HIV interventions, revealed strongly emergent themes related to these individuals' use of HIV biomedical resources and discourses to fashion a new, empowered subjecthood. Experiencing the benefits of antiretroviral therapy (ART) emboldens many individuals to transform their "spoiled" identities to attain new, valorized identities as "advocates for ART" in their communities. We propose that the personal revelation of what some refer to as the "gospel of ARVs," the telling of personal stories about HIV in the public sphere and actions to accompany other PLHIV on their journey into care, is driven by its power to redeem the "spoiled identity:" it permits PLHIV to overcome self-stigma and regain full personhood within their communities. Conclusions: PLHIV are playing an unanticipated but vital role in the successful implementation of HIV care cascade interventions.

Biosecurity aspects of cattle production in Western Uganda, and associations with seroprevalence of brucellosis, salmonellosis and bovine viral diarrhoea	BMC VETERINARY RESEARCH			English	Article						Serology; Biosecurity; Poisson regression; Additive bayesian network; Endemic infections; Disease control; Uganda; Cattle	LIVESTOCK DISEASES; RISK-FACTORS; PREVALENCE; DAIRY; ANTIBODIES; VIRUS; DISTRICTS; EPIDEMIOLOGY; PATTERNS; PROVINCE	Background: Many low-income countries have a human population with a high number of cattle owners depending on their livestock for food and income. Infectious diseases threaten the health and production of cattle, affecting both the farmers and their families as well as other actors in often informal value chains. Many infectious diseases can be prevented by good biosecurity. The objectives of this study were to describe herd management and biosecurity routines with potential impact on the prevalence of infectious diseases, and to estimate the burden of infectious diseases in Ugandan cattle herds, using the seroprevalence of three model infections. Results: Farmer interviews (n = 144) showed that biosecurity measures are rarely practised. Visitors' hand-wash was used by 14%, cleaning of boots or feet by 4 and 79% put new cattle directly into the herd. During the 12 months preceding the interviews, 51% of farmers had cattle that died and 31% had noticed abortions among their cows. Interestingly, 72% were satisfied with the health status of their cattle during the same time period. The prevalence (95% CI) of farms with at least one seropositive animal was 16.7% (11.0;23.8), 23.6% (16.9;31.4), and 53.4% (45.0;61.8) for brucella, salmonella and BVD, respectively. A poisson regression model suggested that having employees looking after the cattle, sharing pasture with other herds, and a higher number of dead cattle were associated with a herd being positive to an increasing number of the diseases. An additive bayesian network model with biosecurity variables and a variable for the number of diseases the herd was positive to resulted in three separate directed acyclic graphs which illustrate how herd characteristics can be grouped together. This model associated the smallest herd size with herds positive to a decreasing number of diseases and having fewer employees. Conclusion: There is potential for improvement of biosecurity practices in Ugandan cattle production. Salmonella, brucella and BVD were prevalent in cattle herds in the study area and these infections are, to some extent, associated with farm management practices.

Information about the relative benefits and drawbacks of different models could inform the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and associated services in resource-limited settings (RLS), especially in light of expanded client populations with country adoption of WHO's test and treat recommendation. Methods: We characterized task-shifting/task-sharing practices in 19 diverse ART clinics in Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia and used cluster analysis to identify unique models of service provision. We ran descriptive statistics to explore how the clusters varied by environmental factors and programmatic characteristics. Finally, we employed the Delphi Method to make systematic use of expert opinions to ensure that the cluster variables were meaningful in the context of actual task-shifting of ART services in SSA. Results: The cluster analysis identified three task-shifting/task-sharing models. The main differences across models were the availability of medical doctors, the scope of clinical responsibility assigned to nurses, and the use of lay health care workers. Patterns of healthcare staffing in HIV service delivery were associated with different environmental factors (e.g., health facility levels, urban vs. rural settings) and programme characteristics (e.g., community ART distribution or integrated tuberculosis treatment on-site). Conclusions: Understanding the relative advantages and disadvantages of different models of care can help national programmes adapt to increased client load, select optimal adherence strategies within decentralized models of care, and identify differentiated models of care for clients to meet the growing needs of long-term ART patients who require more complicated treatment management.

Understanding uptake of an intervention to accelerate antiretroviral therapy initiation in Uganda via qualitative inquiry	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						Implementation Research; Stepped Wedge; PRECEDE framework; PLHIV peer counsellors; ART initiation; Theoretical Domain Framework	OUTCOMES; ADULTS; TRIAL	Introduction: The Streamlined Antiretroviral Therapy Initiation Strategy (START-ART) study found that a theory-based intervention using opinion leaders to inform and coach health care providers about the risks of treatment delay, provision of point of care (POC) CD4 testing machines (PIMA) and reputational incentives, led to rapid rise in ART initiation. We used qualitative research methods to explore mechanisms of provider behaviour change. Methods: We conducted in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 24 health care providers and nine study staff to understand perceptions, attitudes and the context of changes in ART initiation practices. Analyses were informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework. Results: Rapid dissemination of new practices was enabled in the environmental context of an existing relationship based on communication, implementation and accountability between Makerere University Joint AIDS Program (MJAP), a Ugandan University-affiliated organization that provided technical oversight for HIV service delivery at the health facilities where the intervention was implemented, and a network of health facilities operated by the Uganda Ministry of Health. Coaching carried out by field coordinators from MJAP strengthened influence and informal accountability for carrying out the intervention. Frontline health workers held a pre-existing strong sense of professional identity. They were proud of attainment of new knowledge and skills and gratified by providing what they perceived to be higher quality care. Peer counsellors, who were not explicitly targeted in the intervention design, effectively substituted some functions of health care providers; as role models for successful ART uptake, they played a crucial role in creating demand for rapid ART initiation through interactions with patients. Point of care (POC) CD4 testing enabled immediate action and relieved providers from frustrations of lost or delayed laboratory results, and led to higher patient satisfaction (due to reduced costs because of ability to initiate ART right away, requiring fewer return trips to clinic). Conclusions: Qualitative data revealed that a multicomponent intervention to change provider behaviour succeeded in the context of strong institutional and individual relationships between a University-affiliated organization, government facilities, and peer health workers (who acted as a crucial link between stakeholders) and the community. Fostering stable institutional relationships between institutional actors (non-governmental organization (NGOs) and ministry-operated facilities) as well as between facilities and the community (through peer health workers) can enhance uptake of innovations targeting the HIV cascade in similar clinical settings.

However, various diseases constrain their productivity. A two-year retrospective study between April 2012 and March 2014 was conducted using records for cattle and poultry diseases diagnosed at the Central Diagnostic Laboratory (CDL) to determine prevalent diseases in Uganda. The laboratory received 836 samples from poultry (36.3%) and cattle (63.7%). Of the 836 samples, 47.5% had a definitive diagnosis of disease causation. Most of the cattle and poultry diseases diagnosed were protozoan diseases (39.3%) followed by bacterial (21.4%), viral (17.1%), helminthiasis (11.1%), nutritional diseases (4%) and others (7.1%). For poultry, viral diseases (29.5%) and protozoan diseases (27.1%) especially newcastle disease (44.3%) and coccidiosis (100%) respectively, were the most diagnosed. While for cattle, hemo-protozoan parasites (52.1%) were the most prevalent, of which 92.9% were east coast fever infection. Bacterial infection (20.5%) in cattle were the second most diagnosed diseases and mastitis was the most diagnosed (46.2%). In summary, coccidioisis, collibacillosis, newcastle disease, gumboro disease, and avian helminthiasis were the most prevalent poultry diseases while in cattle, east coast fever, helminthiasis, mastitis, brucellosis and rabies were the most frequently diagnosed diseases. This study has identified the major diseases that hinder poultry and cattle production in Uganda. The data generated by CDL could be used for surveillance, monitoring and designing strategic interventions for control of poultry and cattle diseases in Uganda.

Implementing the Angoff method of standard setting using postgraduate students: Practical and affordable in resource-limited	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION			English	Article							PROGRESS; PANEL	Background. Cut scores for students' assessments have always been arbitrarily determined in many institutions. Some institutions have adopted reliable methods of determining cut scores, such as the Angoff method. However, use of this method requires many experts, making it difficult to implement in resource-limited settings. The possibility of involving postgraduate students in implementing the Angoff method of setting cut scores could be the solution to this problem. Objectives. To explore the knowledge and practices of faculty regarding standard setting and the feasibility of using postgraduate students when implementing the Angoff method. Methods. This was an exploratory operations research study in which data were collected during focus group discussions. Students were trained to use the Angoff method, i.e. a previous examination, in which the pass mark was 50%, was used to evaluate the method. Results. Initial findings showed that faculty in the consortia of schools did not know what standard setting and the Angoff method entailed and had never used this approach. The postgraduate students involved in implementing the Angoff method of setting cut scores were excited and interested in engaging in the exercise; the pass mark they arrived at was 61.21%. Conclusion. The study demonstrated that it is feasible to use the Angoff method of determining pass marks, even in resource-limited settings. This can be made possible by involving postgraduate students in the absence of enough faculty experts.	[Mubuuke, A.

Acceptability of cervical cancer screening using visual inspection among women attending a childhood immunization clinic in Uganda	PAPILLOMAVIRUS RESEARCH			English	Article							LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS; ACETIC-ACID; PERCEPTIONS; PREVENTION; BURDEN; TRENDS	Objective: To evaluate the acceptability and performance of cervical cancer (CC) screening using visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) integrated into a rural immunization clinic in Uganda. Methods/materials: We conducted a cross-sectional pilot study in rural Uganda. We explored associations between women's characteristics and acceptance of VIA testing. We collected samples for Papanicolaou (Pap) smear testing in a random subset of women and used results from this test as a comparator for assessing VIA performance. Results: We enrolled 625 women of whom 571 (91.4%) accepted and 54 (8.6%) refused CC screening. In the univariate model, age (Odds Ratio (OR)=1.10; p-value < 0.001) and employment status (OR 2.00; p-value=0.019) were significantly associated with acceptance of VIA screening. In the multivariate model, no characteristic was independently associated with acceptance of VIA screening after adjusting for other factors. Compared to reference Pap smear, CC screening with VIA had a sensitivity of 50% and a specificity of 97.7%. Conclusions: CC screening with VIA is highly acceptable in the setting of rural immunization clinics in Uganda. Studies to assess which screening method would be the most effective and cost-effective are needed before stakeholders can consider adopting screening programs at scale.

In Uganda, both medicinal and food plants are used to handle common pregnancy related conditions. An ethnobotanical survey was conducted in Iganga district, eastern Uganda. Seven traditional birth attendants (TBA) and 46 mothers were interviewed. Data was collected using structured questionnaires and household interviews. The TBAs were identified using snowball sampling. A total of 33 plant species, belonging to 23 families were documented. Out of these, the pregnant mothers used 45.5 % as both food and medicine. The most frequently used plant life form was herbs (58.8%). The leaves are the most commonly used plant parts (59%). Most of the plants (58.8%) were semi cultivated and were being domesticated in crop fields and home gardens. Most of the plants were used to manage anaemia and for child development and good health among the pregnant women. The pregnant women and TBAs in Namungalwe sub County have diverse knowledge on medicinal and nutri-medicinal plants in the management of common pregnancy related diseases, which can be used to supplement modern antenatal services, inspite of the ban of the activities of TBA. Further research on the bioavailability of nutrients, efficacy and safety of the medicinal plants used by pregnant women should be done.

Uganda suffers the highest rate of health workforce absenteeism in Africa, attracting attention but lacking a definitive ameliorative strategy. This study aimed to explore the underlying reasons for absenteeism in the public and private 'not-for-profit' health sector in rural Uganda. Methods We undertook an empirical qualitative study, located within the critical realist paradigm. We used case study methodology as a sampling strategy, and principles of grounded theory for data collection and analysis. Ninety-five healthcare workers were recruited through focus groups and in-depth interviews. The NVivo V.10 software package was used for data management. Results Healthcare workers' absenteeism was explained by complex interrelated influences that could be seen to be both external to, and within, an individual's motivation. External influences dominated in the public sector, especially health system factors, such as delayed or omitted salaries, weak workforce leadership and low financial allocation for workers' accommodation. On the other hand, low staffing-particularly in the private sector-created work overload and stress. Also, socially constructed influences existed, such as the gendered nature of child and elderly care responsibilities, social class expectations and reported feigned sickness. Individually motivated absenteeism arose from perceptions of an inadequate salary, entitlement to absence, financial pressures heightening a desire to seek supplemental income, and educational opportunities, often without study leave. Conclusion Health workforce managers and policy makers need to improve governance efficiencies and to seek learning opportunities across different health providers.

These include both inhibitory KIR2DL1, 2 and 3 and activating KIR2DS1 that recognize either the C1 or C2 epitope of HLA-C. In Europeans KIR2DS5 is essentially monomorphic, with KIR2DS5*002 being predominant. Pioneering investigations showed that KIR2DS5*002 has activating potential, but cannot recognize HLA-A, -B, or -C. Subsequent studies have shown that KIR2DS5 is highly polymorphic in Africans, and that KIR2DS5*006 protects pregnant Ugandan women from preeclampsia. Because inhibitory C2-specific KIR2DL1 correlates with preeclampsia, whereas activating C2-specific KIR2DS1 protects, this association pointed to KIR2DS5*006 being an activating C2-specific receptor. To test this hypothesis we made KIR-Fc fusion proteins from all ten KIR2DS5 allotypes and tested their binding to a representative set of HLA-A, -B and -C allotypes. Results: Six African-specific KIR2DS5 bound to C2(+)HLA-C but not to other HLA class I. Their avidity for C2 is similar to 20% that of C2-specific KIR2DL1 and similar to 40% that of C2-specific KIR2DS1. Among the African C2 receptors is KIR2DS5*006, which protected a cohort of pregnant Ugandans from pre-eclampsia. Three African KIR2DS5 allotypes and KIR2DS5*002, bound no HLA-A, -B or -C. As a group the C2-binding KIR2DS5 allotypes protect against pre-eclampsia compared to the nonbinding KIR2DS5 allotypes. Natural substitutions that contribute to loss or reduction of C2 receptor function are at positions 127, 158, and 176 in the D2 domain. Conclusions: KIR2DS5*005 has the KIR2DS5 consensus sequence, is the only allele found at both centromeric and telomeric locations of KIR2DS5, and is likely the common ancestor of all KIR2DS5 alleles. That KIR2DS5*005 has C2 receptor activity, points to KIR2DS5*002, and other allotypes lacking C2 receptor function, being products of attenuation, a characteristic feature of most KIR B haplotype genes. Alleles encoding attenuated and active KIR2DS5 are present in both centromeric and telomeric locations.

Objectives: To determine the prevalence and factors associated with unknown HIV status among women delivering in Mulago Hospital. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of women that had just delivered. The women's demographic characteristics, health seeking behaviour, health system-related factors and knowledge on PMTCT were collected. Fisher's exact test, Wilcoxon rank sum test and logistic regression were used to test associations. Results: The prevalence of unknown HIV status was 2.6% (10/382). Attending ANC at higher level facilities (OR = 0.1 95% CI 0.0 -0.4) and having been counselled for HIV testing during ANC (OR= 0.1, 95% CI 0.0 -0.4) were associated with likelihood of having a known HIV status. Out of the ten women with unknown HIV status, 4/6 who attended ANC in public/government accredited health facilities "opted out" of HIV testing due to personal reasons. Among the four who attended ANC in private clinics, two were not offered HIV testing and one "opted out". Conclusion: Most participants had a known HIV status at labour (97%). Private clinics need to be supported to provide free quality HCT services in ANC.

There is scarcity of data on HDV in sub-Saharan Africa. We investigated the sero-prevalence and factors associated with HDV antibody among HIV/HBV co-infected patients attending a large urban HIV clinic in Uganda. Methods: We screened 189 HIV/HBV co-infected individuals for anti-HDV immunoglobulin G (IgG) and performed logistic regression to determine the associated factors. Socio-demographic, clinical data, immunological status, and liver fibrosis (as determined by the Aspartate transaminase to platelet ratio index and transient elastography) were included. Results: Participants were predominately young and of sound immunologic status (median age 40 years, median CD4 440 cells/mu l). 98% were on ART regimens containing anti-HBV active medications (95.2% were on TDF/3TC while 4.8% on 3TC containing regimen). Median duration on ART was 36 months (IQR 22-72). Anti-HDV was detected in 6/198, 3.2% (95% CI 1.14-6.92%), associated with male gender and a duration of more than 5 years since HIV diagnosis. Conclusions: The sero-prevalence of HDV antibodies among the HIV/HBV co-infected patients is low in a Ugandan urban cohort.

It has been identified as potentially zoonotic and swine act as main reservoirs. Objectives: The objective of this study was to determine the seroprevalence and risk factors associated with HEV in swine abattoir workers. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study where 45 workers were sampled (N=50), serum collected and tested for presence of anti HEV IgM using ELISA. Results: A seroprevalence of 13.3% was obtained with the highest 50% among slaughterers and the lowest amongst sanitary cleaner, cloth cleaners and inspector. Those in direct contact with live pigs, their carcasses and tissues were at a higher risk compared to those in indirect contact. Seroprevalence was seen to increase with age, with the highest rate among those above 24 years. Conclusion: There is silent HE virus infection in abattoir workers at Wambizi as reflected by presence anti HEV IgM in 13% of the tested serum. However, no single case of HE has ever been reported in swine abattoir workers or general population in Kampala city. This silent maintenance of HEV infection amongst swine abattoir workers is an occupational risk that could challenge public health systems.

Gastrointestinal malignancies at five regional referral hospitals in Uganda	AFRICAN HEALTH SCIENCES			English	Article						Gastrointestinal malignancies; Uganda Regional Referral Hospitals; 10-year trend	GASTRIC-CANCER; CARCINOMA; TRENDS	Background: There is a paucity of published data regarding the trend and distribution of gastrointestinal malignancies in Uganda. Objectives: To study the trend and distribution of gastrointestinal malignancies over a 10 year period at five regional referral hospitals in Uganda. Methods: Patient's charts with histologically confirmed diagnoses of gastrointestinal malignancies for the period 2002-2011 were identified. Case information, which included age at diagnosis, sex, and year of diagnosis, primary anatomic site of the tumour and hospitals attended, was retrospectively abstracted. Patient's clinical and demographic features were compared. Results: Oesophageal cancer was the most common (28.8%) followed by liver (25.8%), stomach (18.4%) and colorectal (14.3%). The mean age at diagnosis for all the cancers was not significantly different in both sexes 54.1, (SD16.1) versus 53.6, (SD 14.7). The highest mean annual number of cases of oesophageal and stomach cancers was 21.8, (SD 15.5) and 16.6, (SD 13.0) respectively from Mbarara Hospital; Lacor had the highest mean annual number of liver cancer cases (21, SD 17.7) followed by Mbale (11.4, SD 8.3). The mean annual number of colorectal cancers was highest in Mbale Hospital (10.3, SD 8.1) followed by Lacor (4.9, SD 3.9). The distribution of oesophageal, liver, stomach and colorectal cancers diagnosed per year across the five referral hospitals was different, P<0.001. Conclusion: Oesophageal, liver, stomach and colorectal cancer remain the most common gastrointestinal malignancies and their rate is increasing in Uganda. There is a need for awareness, endoscopic and radiological assessment of symptomatic individuals and a need for screening of high index patients.

However, little research has been done which examines the experiences of health workers through a gender lens, especially in fragile and post-conflict states. In these contexts, there may not only be opportunities to (re) shape occupational norms and responsibilities in the light of challenges in the health workforce, but also threats that put pressure on resources and undermine gender balance, diversity and gender responsive human resources for health (HRH). We present mixed method research on HRH in four fragile and post-conflict contexts (Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe, northern Uganda and Cambodia) with different histories to understand how gender influences the health workforce. We apply a gender analysis framework to explore access to resources, occupations, values, decision-making and power. We draw largely on life histories with male and female health workers to explore their lived experiences, but complement the analysis with evidence from surveys, document reviews, key informant interviews, human resource data and stakeholder mapping. Our findings shed light on patterns of employment: in all contexts women predominate in nursing and midwifery cadres, are under-represented in management positions and are clustered in lower paying positions. Gendered power relations shaped by caring responsibilities at the household level, affect attitudes to rural deployment and women in all contexts face challenges in accessing both pre- and in-service training. Coping strategies within conflict emerged as a key theme, with experiences here shaped by gender, poverty and household structure. Most HRH regulatory frameworks did not sufficiently address gender concerns. Unless these are proactively addressed post-crisis, health workforces will remain too few, poorly distributed and unable to meet the health needs of vulnerable populations. Practical steps need to be taken to identify gender barriers proactively and engage staff and communities on best approaches for change.

To assess the effectiveness of Short Message Service (SMS) reminder messages on antiretroviral and cotrimoxazole prophylaxis adherence among HIV-positive youths as well as the relative effectiveness of SMS with and without a response option. Methods. Eligible HIV-positive patients aged 15 to 22 years at 2 HIV clinics in Kampala, Uganda, participated in a year-long parallel individual-randomized controlled trial and were assigned in a 1-to-1-to-1 ratio to a weekly SMS message group, weekly SMS message with response option group, or a usual-care control group. Results. We enrolled 332 participants. Electronically measured mean adherence was 67% in the control group, 64% in the 1-way SMS group (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.77, 1.14), and 61% in the 2-way SMS group (95% CI = 0.75, 1.12) in an intent-to-treat analysis. Results for secondary outcomes and complete-case analysis were similarly statistically insignificant across groups. Conclusions. Despite previous evidence that interventions using SMS reminders can promote antiretroviral therapy adherence, this study shows that they are not always effective in achieving behavior change. More research is needed to find out for whom, and under what conditions, they can be beneficial.

Objective: This trial aims to evaluate the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy delivered by trained lay health workers to persons living with HIV (PLWH) with depression in primary care. Methods: Thirty eligible primary care health centers across three districts were randomly allocated to have their lay health workers trained to deliver group support psychotherapy (intervention arm) or group HIV education and treatment as usual (control arm) to PLWH with depression. Treated PLWH will be evaluated at baseline, after the end of treatment, and at 6-month intervals thereafter for 2 years. Primary outcomes will be the difference in follow-up proportions of participants with Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria for major depression and difference in follow-up function scores of participants in the intervention and control arms 6 months after the end of treatment. Secondary outcomes will include measures of self-esteem, posttraumatic stress symptoms, social support, stigma, adherence to antiretroviral therapy, viral load, and number of disability days, asset possession indices, and cost-effectiveness data. Primary and secondary outcomes as well as subgroup analyses will be conducted at the individual level using multilevel random effects regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centers. A process evaluation using mixed methods to assess acceptability, feasibility, fidelity, causal mediating processes, and contextual influences in the trial will be conducted. Results: The trial has been approved by the Makerere College of Health Sciences School of Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee, the AIDS Support Organization, and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. A data and safety monitoring board has been put in place to monitor trial progress. A total of 1140 persons living with HIV have been recruited to the trial. An analysis of baseline and 6-month data is in progress. The results of this trial will not only be presented at national and international conferences but also submitted for publication in peer-reviewed journals and as a report to the funding agencies. Conclusions: This cluster randomized trial will provide critical evidence to support culturally sensitive group-based psychotherapy for depression treatment in sub-Saharan Africa. Process evaluation outcomes will provide contextual information that health care and public health stakeholders can use to guide implementation decisions for their particular setting.

Analysis of Farmer's Choices for Climate Change Adaptation Practices in South-Western Uganda, 1980-2009	CLIMATE			English	Article						climate change; small-holders; adaptation practices; Albertine Graben-Uganda	GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY; WATER; SOIL; CHALLENGES	Climate change is a serious threat to the livelihoods of rural communities, particularly in mountainous areas because they are very sensitive to such changes. In this study, we assessed the household determinants to climate change adaptation drawing from a case study of agricultural adaptation in the Mount Rwenzori area of South Western Uganda. The study identified the major adaptation practices that are adopted by farmers to cope with the impacts of climate change and using available on-farm technologies. A total of 143 smallholder farmers were sampled and interviewed using field based questionnaires, field observations, and key informant interviews. Data was cleaned, entered and analysed using SPSS and Stata software for descriptive statistics. Thereafter, a Multinomial logistic regression model was used to assess the drivers of farmers' choice for adaptation practices, factors influencing the choice of adaptation, and barriers. The major adaptation practices that were identified included; use of different crop varieties, tree planting, soil and water conservation, early and late planting, and furrow irrigation. Discrete choice model results indicated the age of the household head, experience in farming, household size, climate change shocks, land size, use of agricultural inputs, landscape position (location), and crop yield varied significantly (p > 0.05), which influenced farmers' choice of climate change adaptation practices. The main barriers to adaptation included inadequate information on adaptation methods and financial constraints, leading us to conclude that contextual adaptation practices are more desirable for adoption to farmers. Adapting to climate change needs support from government and other stakeholders, however the implementation is more successful when appropriate and suitable choices are employed.

Decentralizing clinical training can alleviate this tension. This study assessed the impact of decentralized training and contribution of undergraduate medical students at health facilities. Method Participants were from 11 Medical Education Partnership Initiative-funded medical schools in 10 African countries. Each school identified two clinical training sites-one rural and the other either peri-urban or urban. Qualitative and quantitative data collection tools were used to gather information about the sites, student activities, and staff perspectives between March 2015 and February 2016. Interviews with site staff were analyzed using a collaborative directed approach to content analysis, and frequencies were generated to describe site characteristics and student experiences. Results The clinical sites varied in level of care but were similar in scope of clinical services and types of clinical and nonclinical student activities. Staff indicated that students have a positive effect on job satisfaction and workload. Respondents reported that students improved the work environment, institutional reputation, and introduced evidence-based approaches. Students also contributed to perceived improvements in quality of care, patient experience, and community outreach. Staff highlighted the need for resources to support students. Conclusions Students were seen as valuable resources for health facilities. They strengthened health care quality by supporting overburdened staff and by bringing rigor and accountability into the work environment. As medical schools expand, especially in low-resource settings, mobilizing new and existing resources for decentralized clinical training could transform health facilities into vibrant service and learning environments.

Iron retention in iron-fortified rice and use of iron-fortified rice to treat women with iron deficiency: A pilot study	BBA CLINICAL			English	Article						Iron; Rice; Anemia; Fortification; Hemoglobin	MICRONUTRIENT DEFICIENCIES; FORTIFICATION; CHILDREN; INITIATIVES; VITAMIN; BURDEN; PLASMA; ANEMIA; SCALE	Objectives: 1. Evaluate the effect of washing and cooking iron-fortified rice on iron retention and bioavailability. 2. Evaluate the effect of iron-fortified rice on women with iron deficiency anemia Methods: 1. Iron-fortified rice (18 mg/100 g as FeSO4) was cooked in Baton Rouge, Louisiana (C), rinsed and cooked (RC), fried and cooked (FC), cooked with extra water (CW), or soaked and cooked with extra water (SCW), and iron retention was determined. 2. Rice samples were cooked in Kampala, Uganda in a lab (C-Uganda) and households using traditional cooking method (TC-Uganda) and iron retention were determined. 3. Seventeen women with iron deficiency (low iron and/or low ferritin) anemia were randomized to 100 g/d of rice (two cooked 0.75 cup servings) for two weeks containing 18 mg/d iron (supplemented) or 0.5 mg/d iron (unsupplemented). Hemoglobin and hematocrit were evaluated at baseline and 2 weeks with other measures of iron metabolism. Results: 1. Iron retention, from highest to lowest, was (C), (RC), (FC), (C-Uganda), (CW), (SCW) and (TCUganda). 2. Seventeen women were randomized and 15 completed the study (hemoglobin 10.6 +/- 1.6 g, hematocrit 33.7 +/- 4.1%), 9 in the iron-fortified rice group and 6 in the un-fortified rice group. The iron-fortified group had a greater increase in hemoglobin (0.82 g, p = 0.0035) and Hematocrit (1.83%, p = 0.0248) with directional differences in other measures of iron metabolism favoring the iron-fortified group. Conclusions: Iron-fortified rice increased hemoglobin and hematocrit in women with iron-deficient anemia. Iron deficiency and anemia are widespread in Southeast Asia and Africa and undermine development in these regions.	[Losso, J. N.; Karki, N.; Finley, J.

J	Nannozi, V; Wobudeya, E; Gahagan, J				Nannozi, Victoria; Wobudeya, Eric; Gahagan, Jacqueline			Fear of an HIV positive test result: an exploration of the low uptake of couples HIV counselling and testing (CHCT) in a rural setting in Mukono district, Uganda	GLOBAL HEALTH PROMOTION			English	Article						couple HIV counselling and testing; fear; disclosure	EASTERN UGANDA; TRADITIONAL MEDICINE; DISCORDANT COUPLES; MEN; PREVENTION; HIV/AIDS; AFRICA; CARE; TRANSMISSION; INDIVIDUALS	Background: Couples HIV counselling and testing (CHCT) is a key preventive strategy used to reduce the spread of HIV. In Uganda, HIV prevalence among married or cohabiting couples is 5.6%, compared to 2.2% among those never married. CHCT can help ease disclosure of HIV positive status, which in turn may help increase opportunities to obtain social supports and reduce new infections. The purpose of this study was aimed at exploring the possible reasons for the low uptake of CHCT in Mukono district, a rural in setting in Uganda. Methods: The study was conducted in two sub-counties in a rural district (Mukono district) using a descriptive qualitative research design. Specifically, we conducted four focus group discussions and 10 key informant interviews. We also interviewed 53 individuals in couple relationships. Data were collected mainly in the local language Luganda and English, all data were transcribed into English and coded for emergent themes. Ethical clearance for this study was obtained from the Mengo Hospital Research Review Board and from the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology. Results: Fear of a positive HIV test result emerged strongly as the most significant barrier to CHCT. To a lesser extent, perceptions and knowledge of CHCT, mistrust in marriages and culture were also noted by participants as important barriers to the uptake of CHCT among couples. Participants offered suggestions on ways to overcome these barriers, including peer couple counselling, offering incentives to couples that test together and door-to-door CHCT testing. Conclusion: In an effort to improve the uptake of CHCT, it is crucial to involve both females and males in the planning and implementation of CHCT, as well as to address the misconceptions about CHCT and to prioritise CHCT within health care systems management.

Methods: Qualitative methods, with a purposive sample of women in Nigeria and Uganda. Participants were asked to define quality of care and to provide examples of when it was and was not provided. Thematic analysis was used to synthesize findings based on an a priori framework (the WHO quality of care framework). Results: 132 in-depth interviews and 21 focus group discussions are included. Participants spontaneously discussed each of the WHO framework domains of quality of care. Data were richest across the domains of effective communication, respect and dignity, emotional support, competent and motivated human resources, and essential physical resources. Women believed that good quality of care ensured optimal psychological and physiological outcomes for the woman and her baby. Positive interpersonal relationships between women and health providers were important. These included supportive care, building rapport, and using positive and clear language. Conclusion: To provide good quality of care, maternity services should consider and act on the expectations and experiences of women and their families.

Methods: Thematic analysis of qualitative data (in-depth interviews [IDIs] and focus group discussions [FDGs]) obtained from a purposive sample of healthcare providers and managers in selected health facilities in Nigeria and Uganda. Results: A total of 70 IDIs and 16 FGDs with doctors, midwives, and administrators are included in this analysis. Labor monitoring encompasses a broad scope of care jointly provided by doctors and midwives. A range of contextual limitations was identified as barriers to monitoring labor progression, including staff shortages, lack of team cooperation, delays in responding to abnormal labor observations, suboptimal provider-patient dynamics, and limitations in partograph use. Perceived opportunities to improve current practices included streamlining clinical team cooperation, facilitating provider-client communication, encouraging women's uptake of offered care, bridging the gaps in the continuum of monitoring tasks between cadres, and improving skills in assessment of labor progress, and accuracy in its documentation. Conclusion: Healthcare providers face many challenges to effective monitoring of labor progress in low-resource settings. This analysis presents potential opportunities to improve labor monitoring practices and tools in these contexts.

Expectations and needs of Ugandan women for improved quality of childbirth care in health facilities: A qualitative study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Childbirth; Facility birth; Hospital birth; Maternal health; Quality of care; Uganda	OF-CARE; PERSPECTIVES	Objective: To describe the experiences, expectations, and needs of urban Ugandan women in relation to good-quality facility childbirth. Methods: Women who had given birth in the 12months prior to the study were purposively sampled and interviewed, or included in focus groups. Thematic analysis was used, and the data were interpreted within the context of an existing quality of care framework. Results: Forty-five in-depth interviews and six focus group discussions were conducted. Respect and dignity, timely communication, competent skilled staff, and availability of medical supplies were central to women's accounts of quality care, or a lack of it. The hope for a live baby motivated women to seek facility-based childbirth. They expected to encounter competent, respectful, and caring staff with appropriate skills. In some cases, they could only fulfill these expectations through additional personal financial payments to staff, for clinical supplies, or to guarantee that they would be attended by someone with suitable skills. Conclusion: Long-term improvement in quality of maternity care in Uganda requires enhancement of the interaction between women and health staff in facilities, and investment in staff and resources to ensure that safe, respectful care is not dependent on willingness and/or capacity to pay.

This paper presents the development of negotiated standards for effective labor and childbirth care in selected hospitals and communities in Nigeria and Uganda. Methods: A four-step development process involving different methodologies. The process included: (1) review and synthesis of internationally recognized intrapartum clinical principles and practices; (2) primary qualitative research to assess values and preferences of women and healthcare providers, and practices that align with these preferences; (3) draft contextualization of effective and ineffective behaviors to reflect values and preferences; and (4) WHO-mediated negotiations between relevant stakeholders, including community members, providers, and administrators. Results: The primary outcomes of this process were a comprehensive set of effective behaviors and clinical practices covering the main domains of quality of care, which are practical and easy to communicate, implement, and audit across all levels of healthcare delivery. Conclusion: The process demonstrates that health facilities and providers can be motivated to adopt standards of care that uphold the values and preferences of both service users and providers, while adhering to international best practices.

Methods: As part of the WHO Better Outcomes in Labour Difficulty (BOLD) project, a service design approach was used in eight Ugandan and Nigerian health facilities and communities to develop the Passport to Safer Birth. There are three phases: Research for Design, Concept Design, and Detail Design. These generated design principles, design archetype personas, and Passport prototypes. Data collection methods included desk research, interviews, group discussions, and journey mapping to identify touchpoints where the woman interacts with the health system. Results: A total of 90 interviews, 12 observation hours, and 15 group discussions were undertaken. The resulting design principles were: a shared and deeper understanding of pregnancy and childbirth among family and community; family readiness for decision-making and action; and the woman's sense of being in control and being cared for. Four archetype personas of women emerged: Vulnerable; Passive; Empowered; Accepter. Subsequent development of the Passport to Safer Birth tools addressed three domains: Care Mediator; Expectation Manager; and Pregnancy Assistant.

This paper describes the Passport to Safer Birth concept and the tools developed as a result. Methods: Service design methods were used to identify facilitators and barriers to quality care, and to develop human-centered solutions. The service design process had three phases: Research for Design, Concept Design, and Detail Design, undertaken in eight hospitals and catchment communities. Results: The service concept "Better Beginnings" comprises three tools. The Pregnancy Purse provides educational information to women throughout pregnancy. The "Birth Board" is a visual communication tool that presents the labor and childbirth process. The "Family Pass" is a set of wearable passes for the woman and her supporter to facilitate communication of care preferences. Conclusion: The Better Beginnings service concept and tools form the basis for the promotion of access to information and knowledge acquisition, and could improve communication between the healthcare provider, the woman, and her family during childbirth.

Machine learning (ML) methods have the ability to identify and discover patterns in complex datasets and predict future outcomes of HIV treatment. We survey published studies that make use of ML techniques in HIV clinical research and care. An advanced search relevant to the use of ML in HIV research was conducted in the PubMed biomedical database. The survey outcomes of interest include data sources, ML techniques, ML tasks and ML application paradigms. A growing trend in application of ML in HIV research was observed. The application paradigm has diversified to include practical clinical application, but statistical analysis remains the most dominant application. There is an increase in the use of genomic sources of data and high performance non-parametric ML methods with a focus on combating resistance to antiretroviral therapy (ART). There is need for improvement in collection of health records data and increased training in ML so as to translate ML research into clinical application in HIV management.

Uganda is among the top African countries with high number of slums. The status of Katanga slum located in the low-lands between Mulago national hospital and Makerere University is a typical of many other slums within Uganda. This project proposal seeks to tackle urbanization challenges by specializing in slum upgrading as a sustainable way of curbing the menace. An integrated toilet, biogas, poultry and backyard gardening project is proposed as a channel of boosting the Katanga slum dwellers' economic, sanitation and domestic energy status. Designed to serve up to 30 households, the project will utilize residual wastes from poultry houses and toilets to produce biogas and slurry. The biogas yield will provide clean cooking fuel and energy for lighting, while the slurry used as organic fertilizers to improve vegetable yields. The social, economic and environmental impacts of the project will empower the vulnerable women and children within the slums and reduce water pollution and land degradation. This affordable project can be applied in developing countries experiencing slum settlement challenges as a strategy for reducing urbanization pressure.

Altered angiogenesis as a common mechanism underlying preterm birth, small for gestational age, and stillbirth in women living with HIV	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						angiogenesis; HIV-1; placental growth factor; pregnancy; preterm birth; small for gestational age; soluble endoglin; soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1; stillbirth	ENDOTHELIAL ACTIVATION BIOMARKERS; PLACENTAL GROWTH-FACTOR; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; SOLUBLE ENDOGLIN; INFECTED WOMEN; SERUM CONCENTRATIONS; NORMAL-PREGNANCY; PLASMA; PREECLAMPSIA; INHIBITOR	BACKGROUND: Angiogenic processes in the placenta are critical regulators of fetal growth and impact birth outcomes, but there are limited data documenting these processes in HIV-infected women or women from low-resource settings. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether angiogenic factors are associated with adverse birth outcomes in HIV-infected pregnant women started on antiretroviral therapy. STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of samples collected as part of a clinical trial randomizing pregnant women and adolescents infected with HIV to lopinavir/ritonavir-based (n = 166) or efavirenz-based (n = 160) antiretroviral therapy in Tororo, Uganda. Pregnant women living with HIV were enrolled between 12-28 weeks of gestation. Plasma samples were evaluated for angiogenic biomarkers (angiopoietin-1, angiopoietin-2, vascular endothelial growth factor, soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, placental growth factor, and soluble endoglin) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay between: 16-<20, 20-<24, 24-<28, 28-<32, 32-<36, 36-<37 weeks of gestation. The primary outcome was preterm birth. RESULTS: In all, 1115 plasma samples from 326 pregnant women and adolescents were evaluated. There were no differences in angiogenic factors according to antiretroviral therapy group (P>.05 for all). The incidence of adverse birth outcomes was 16.9% for spontaneous preterm births, 25.6% for small-for-gestational-age births, and 2.8% for stillbirth. We used linear mixed effect modelling to evaluate longitudinal changes in angiogenic factor concentrations between birth outcome groups adjusting for gestational age at venipuncture, maternal age, body mass index, gravidity, and the interaction between treatment arm and gestational age. Two angiogenic factors-soluble endoglin and placental growth factor-were associated with adverse birth outcomes. Significantly higher concentrations of soluble endoglin throughout gestation were found in study participants destined to deliver preterm [likelihood ratio test, chi(2) (1) = 12.28, P<.0005] and in those destined to have stillbirths [chi(2) (1) = 5.67, P<.02]. By contrast, significantly lower concentrations of placental growth factor throughout gestation were found in those destined to have small-forgestational-age births [chi(2) (1) = 7.89, P<.005] and in those destined to have stillbirths [chi(2) (1) =21.59, P<.0001]. CONCLUSION: An antiangiogenic state in the second or third trimester is associated with adverse birth outcomes, including stillbirth in women and adolescents living with HIV and receiving antiretroviral therapy.

Influence of Dietary Salt Knowledge, Perceptions, and Beliefs on Consumption Choices after Stroke in Uganda	JOURNAL OF STROKE & CEREBROVASCULAR DISEASES			English	Article						Sodium; dietary salt; stroke; hypertension; sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda	POSTSTROKE HYPERTENSION	Background: Previous research on Uganda's poststroke population revealed that their level of dietary salt knowledge did not lead to healthier consumption choices. Purpose: Identify barriers and motivators for healthy dietary behaviors and evaluate the understanding of widely accepted salt regulation mechanisms among poststroke patients in Uganda. Methods: Convergent parallel mixed methods triangulation design comprised a cross-sectional survey (n = 81) and 8 focus group discussions with 7-10 poststroke participants in each group. We assessed participant characteristics and obtained insights into their salt consumption attitudes, perceptions, and knowledge. Qualitative responses were analyzed using an inductive approach with thematic analytic procedures. Relationships between healthy dietary salt compliance, dietary salt knowledge, and participant characteristics were assessed using logistic regression analyses. Results: Healthy dietary salt consumption behaviors were associated with basic salt knowledge (P <.0001), but no association was found between compliance and salt disease-related knowledge (P =.314). Only 20% and 7% obtained health-related salt knowledge from their health facility and educational sources, respectively, whereas 44% obtained this information from media personalities; 92% of participants had no understanding of nutrition labels, and only 25% of the study population consumed potash-an inexpensive salt substitute that is both rich in potassium and low in sodium. Conclusion: One barrier to healthy dietary consumption choices among Uganda's stroke survivors is a lack of credible disease-related information. Improving health-care provider strokerelated dietary knowledge in Uganda and encouraging the use of potash as a salt substitute would help reduce hypertension and thereby lower the risk of stroke.

J	Babweteera, F; Ssekuubwa, E				Babweteera, Fred; Ssekuubwa, Enock			Predicting which tropical tree species are vulnerable to forest disturbances	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECOLOGY			English	Article						fruit; seed size; light demanders; logging; seed dispersal; shade tolerants	RAIN-FOREST; SEED DISPERSAL; NATIONAL-PARK; EXTINCTION; MANAGEMENT; PRIMATES; MAMMALS; CANOPY; GABON	Tropical forest management often focuses on a few high-value timber species because they are thought to be the most vulnerable in logged forests. However, other tree species may be vulnerable to secondary effects of logging, like loss of vertebrate dispersers. We examined vulnerability of tree species to loss of vertebrate dispersers in Mabira, a heavily disturbed tropical rainforest in Uganda. Fruit characteristics and shade tolerance regimes of 269 tree species were compiled. Stem densities of tree species producing fruits of various sizes and having different shade tolerance regimes were computed for Mabira and compared with densities of conspecifics in Budongo, a less disturbed forest with similar floral composition. Seventy per cent of tree species in Mabira are animal-dispersed, of which 10% are large-fruited light demanders. These species are the most vulnerable because they rarely recruit beneath adult conspecifics and are exclusively dispersed by large vertebrates, also vulnerable in heavily disturbed forests. Comparison of densities between Mabira and Budongo showed that large-fruited light demanders had a lower density in Mabira. Other categories of tree species had similar densities in both forests. It is plausible that the low density of large-fruited light demanders is due to limited recruitment caused by dispersal limitations.

Several countries, including Mali, Nigeria, and Senegal, experienced Ebola importations. Realizing the importance of a trained field epidemiology workforce in neighboring countries to respond to Ebola importations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Field Epidemiology Training Program unit implemented the Surveillance Training for Ebola Preparedness (STEP) initiative. STEP was a mentored, competency-based initiative to rapidly build up surveillance capacity along the borders of the at-risk neighboring countries Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, Senegal, and Guinea-Bissau. The target audience was district surveillance officers. STEP was delivered to 185 participants from 72 health units (districts or regions). Timeliness of reporting and the quality of surveillance analyses improved 3 months after training. STEP demonstrated that mentored, competency-based training, where learners attain competencies while delivering essential public health services, can be successfully implemented in an emergency response setting.

Changing Antimalarial Drug Sensitivities in Uganda	ANTIMICROBIAL AGENTS AND CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article						Plasmodium falciparum; Uganda; artemether-lumefantrine; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine; drug resistance; ex vivo; k13; pfcrt; pfmdr1; plasmepsin 2	PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; RESISTANCE-MEDIATING POLYMORPHISMS; DIHYDROARTEMISININ-PIPERAQUINE; ARTEMISININ RESISTANCE; ARTEMETHER-LUMEFANTRINE; IN-VITRO; COMBINATION THERAPIES; MULTIDRUG-RESISTANCE; MOLECULAR MARKERS; SELECTION	Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has demonstrated excellent efficacy for the treatment and prevention of malaria in Uganda. However, resistance to both components of this regimen has emerged in Southeast Asia. The efficacy of artemether-lumefantrine, the first-line regimen to treat malaria in Uganda, has also been excellent, but continued pressure may select for parasites with decreased sensitivity to lumefantrine. To gain insight into current drug sensitivity patterns, ex vivo sensitivities were assessed and genotypes previously associated with altered drug sensitivity were characterized for 58 isolates collected in Tororo, Uganda, from subjects presenting in 2016 with malaria from the community or as part of a clinical trial comparing DP chemoprevention regimens. Compared to community isolates, those from trial subjects had lower sensitivities to the aminoquinolines chloroquine, monodesethyl amodiaquine, and piperaquine and greater sensitivities to lumefantrine and mefloquine, an observation consistent with DP selection pressure. Compared to results for isolates from 2010 to 2013, the sensitivities of 2016 community isolates to chloroquine, amodiaquine, and piperaquine improved (geometric mean 50% inhibitory concentrations [IC50] = 248, 76.9, and 19.1 nM in 2010 to 2013 and 33.4, 14.9, and 7.5 nM in 2016, respectively [P < 0.001 for all comparisons]), the sensitivity to lumefantrine decreased (IC50 = 3.0 nM in 2010 to 2013 and 5.4 nM in 2016 [P < 0.001]), and the sensitivity to dihydroartemisinin was unchanged (IC50 = 1.4 nM). These changes were accompanied by decreased prevalence of transporter mutations associated with aminoquinoline resistance and low prevalence of polymorphisms recently associated with resistance to artemisinins or piperaquine. Antimalarial drug sensitivities are changing in Uganda, but novel genotypes associated with DP treatment failure in Asia are not prevalent.

Pilot Use of a Novel Tool to Assess Neurosurgical Capacity in Uganda	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Neurosurgery; Sub-Saharan Africa; Surgical capacity; Uganda	SURGICAL CAPACITY; INTERRATER RELIABILITY; SURGERY; ANESTHESIA; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; INJURIES; BURDEN; INDEX	INTRODUCTION: There is a significant burden of unmet surgical need in many low- and middle-income countries (> 80% in parts of Africa). This need is even larger for specialties such as neurosurgery. Surgical capacity tools have been developed and used to assess needs and plan for resource allocation. This study piloted a new tool to assess neurosurgical capacity and describes its use. METHODS: A surgical capacity tool was adapted to assess neurosurgical capacity. An expert panel of neuro-surgeons and researchers reviewed the Surgeons Over-Seas PIPES (personnel, infrastructure, procedures, equipment, and supplies) assessment and added additional items essential to perform common neurosurgery procedures. This tool was then piloted at 3 public hospitals in Uganda and each hospital was given a score of neurosurgical capacity. At 1 hospital, 3 respondents were asked to answer the survey to assess reliability. RESULTS: The hospital with the largest neurosurgery caseload and 5 neurosurgeons scored the highest on our survey, followed by a regional hospital with 1 practicing neurosurgeon. The third hospital, without a neurosurgeon, scored the lowest on the scale. At the hospital that completed the reliability assessment, scores were varied between respondents. CONCLUSIONS: NeuroPIPES survey scores were in keeping with the number of neurosurgeons and respective caseloads of each hospital. However, the variation in scores between respondents at the same hospital suggests that adaptations could be made to the tool that may improve reliability and validity. The methodology used to create NeuroPIPES may be successfully applied to a variety of other surgical subspecialties for similar assessments.

Interruption of anti-retroviral therapy (ART) could lead to perturbations in reconstitution of T cells in HIV/tuberculosis (TB) patients. Objectives: To ascertain the effect of interrupted ART on reconstitution of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T sub-sets in TB patients. Methods: Participants with HIV (CD4>350 cells/mu L) and TB were recruited under a larger phase 3 open label randomised controlled clinical trial. The CD45RO and CD62L markers were measured on CD4(+) and CD8(+) cells by flow cytometry. Samples were analysed at baseline, 3, 6, 12 months. Results: There was a significant increase of naive CD8(+) cells (p = 0.003) and a decrease in effector CD8(+) cells (p = 0.004) among participants in ART/TB treatment arm during the first 6 months. Withdrawing ART led to naive CD8(+) cells reduction (p = 0.02) to values close to baseline. An increase of naive CD8(+) cells after 6 months of TB treatment in TB alone treatment arm (p = 0.01) was observed. A trend towards increment of naive CD4(+) sub sets in either treatment arms was observed. Conclusion: Interrupting ART alters CD8(+) but not CD4(+) sub-sets in patients with less advanced HIV infection and TB.

Gender dynamics affecting maternal health and health care access and use in Uganda	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Gender; gender analysis; health systems; maternal health; Uganda	FINANCIAL INCENTIVES; CHILDBIRTH; SYSTEMS; MEN	Despite its reduction over the last decade, the maternal mortality rate in Uganda remains high, due to in part a lack of access to maternal health care. In an effort to increase access to care, a quasi-experimental trial using vouchers was implemented in Eastern Uganda between 2009 and 2011. Findings from the trial reported a dramatic increase in pregnant women's access to institutional delivery. Sustainability of such interventions, however, is an important challenge. While such interventions are able to successfully address immediate access barriers, such as lack of financial resources and transportation, they are reliant on external resources to sustain them and are not designed to address the underlying causes contributing to women's lack of access, including those related to gender. In an effort to examine ways to sustain the intervention beyond external financial resources, project implementers conducted a follow-up qualitative study to explore the root causes of women's lack of maternal health care access and utilization. Based on emergent findings, a gender analysis of the data was conducted to identify key gender dynamics affecting maternal health and maternal health care. This paper reports the key gender dynamics identified during the analysis, by detailing how gender power relations affect maternal health care access and utilization in relation to: access to resources; division of labour, including women's workload during and after pregnancy and lack of male involvement at health facilities; social norms, including perceptions of women's attitudes and behaviour during pregnancy, men's attitudes towards fatherhood, attitudes towards domestic violence, and health worker attitudes and behaviour; and decision-making. It concludes by discussing the need for integrating gender into maternal health care interventions if they are to address the root causes of barriers to maternal health access and utilization and improve access to and use of maternal health care in the long term.

The papers interrogate differing health issues and core health systems functions using a gender lens. Together they produce new knowledge on the multiple impacts of gender on health experiences and demonstrate the importance of gender analyses and gender sensitive interventions for promoting well-being and health systems strengthening. The findings from these papers collectively show how gender intersects with other axes of inequity within specific contexts to shape experiences of health and health seeking within households, communities and health systems; illustrate how gender power relations affect access to important resources; and demonstrate that gender norms, poverty and patriarchy interplay to limit women's choices and chances both within household interactions and within the health sector. Health systems researchers have a responsibility to promote the incorporation of gender analyses into their studies in order to inform more strategic, effective and equitable health systems interventions, programmes, and policies. Responding to gender inequitable systems, institutions, and services in this sector requires an 'all hands-on deck' approach. We cannot claimto take a 'people-centred approach' to health systems if the status quo continues.

Out of this focus emerges a research frontier that demands sustained, detailed studies of the links between multi-faceted and multi-scalar development processes and risk but also the re-thinking of scale and jurisdiction as ordering concepts; a stronger understanding of the linkages between environmental/public health risks and small and extreme disasters, and relative changes in manifestations of these forms of risk and in their social differentiation; and better theorisation of governance innovations. For practice, the issue stresses the over-riding need to move beyond a narrow focus on hazard or disaster events and the immediate actors involved to engage a much wider set of actors in integrated planning processes; to develop data to enable holistic policy-making and to build on the emergence of demand-led planning to re-frame the practices of risk-sensitive and resilient urban development.

The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of and factors predicting end-of-life chemotherapy administration in Uganda. Methods Retrospective chart review and surveys and interviews of providers were performed at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI), the only comprehensive cancer center in the area, which serves a catchment area of greater than 100 million people. All adult patients at the UCI with reported cancer deaths between January 1, 2014, and August 31, 2015 were included. All UCI physicians were offered a survey, and a subset of physicians were also individually interviewed. Results Three hundred ninety-two patients (65.9%) received chemotherapy. Age less than 55 years (odds ratio [OR], 2.30; P=.004), a cancer diagnosis greater than 60 days before death (OR, 9.13; P<. 001), and a presenting Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 2 (OR, 2.47; P =.001) were associated with the administration of chemotherapy. More than 45% of patients received chemotherapy in the last 30 days of life. No clinical factors were predictive of chemotherapy use in the last 30 days of life, although doctors reported using performance status, cancer stage, and tumor chemotherapy sensitivity to determine when to administer chemotherapy. Patient expectations and a lack of outcomes data were important nonclinical factors influencing chemotherapy administration. Conclusion Chemotherapy is administered to a high proportion of patients with terminal cancer in Uganda, raising concern about efficacy. Late presentation of cancer in Uganda complicates end-of-life chemotherapy recommendations, necessitating guidelines specific to sub-Saharan Africa.

GHASSA	Hepatitis B in sub-Saharan Africa: strategies to achieve the 2030 elimination targets	LANCET GASTROENTEROLOGY & HEPATOLOGY			English	Article							LIVER-RELATED MORTALITY; TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; VIRUS-INFECTION; HEPATOCELLULAR-CARCINOMA; SURFACE-ANTIGEN; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; PERINATAL TRANSMISSION; NATURAL-HISTORY; CARRIER MOTHERS; LATE PREGNANCY	The WHO global health sector strategy on viral hepatitis, created in May, 2016, aims to achieve a 90% reduction in new cases of chronic hepatitis B and C and a 65% reduction in mortality due to hepatitis B and C by 2030. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa, and despite the introduction of universal hepatitis B vaccination and effective antiviral therapy, the estimated overall seroprevalence of hepatitis B surface antigen remains high at 6.1% (95% uncertainty interval 4.6-8.5). In this Series paper, we have reviewed the literature to examine the epidemiology, burden of liver disease, and elimination strategies of hepatitis B in sub-Saharan Africa. This paper reflects a supranational perspective of sub-Saharan Africa, and recommends several priority elimination strategies that address the need both to prevent new infections and to diagnose and treat chronic infections. The key to achieving these elimination goals in sub-Saharan Africa is the effective prevention of new infections via universal implementation of the HBV birth-dose vaccine, full vaccine coverage, access to affordable diagnostics to identify HBV-infected individuals, and to enable linkage to care and antiviral therapy.

Africa, and more specifically, sub-Saharan Africa, carries a substantial portion of the global burden of viral hepatitis, especially chronic hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus infections. The task that lies ahead for sub-Saharan Africa to achieve elimination is substantial, but not insurmountable. Major developments in the management of hepatitis C have put elimination within reach, but several difficulties will need to be navigated on the path to elimination. Many of the challenges faced are unique to sub-Saharan Africa and the development of strategies is complicated by a scarcity of good data from countries and regions within sub-Saharan Africa. However, this hindrance should not act as a barrier to delay interventions in screening, detection, and linkage to care. Moreover, by sharing experiences from across sub-Saharan Africa, countries can create supranational synergies to develop their programmes and work together in a more cohesive manner to tackle the burden of hepatitis C in sub-Saharan Africa. In this Series paper, several issues related to hepatitis C in sub-Saharan Africa are addressed, including prevalence, risk factors, and fibrosis assessment, and recommendations are given by experts from across the region. Simplified diagnostic algorithms and treatment regimens for both HIV co-infected and hepatitis C mono-infected patients are suggested. The recommendations are consensus based and provided to guide the development of programmes in sub-Saharan Africa. Political will and appropriate funding will be required to provide impetus to implement these recommendations.	[Sonderup, Mark W.; Gogela, Neliswa; Spearman, C.

We aimed to examine cerebral palsy prevalence and subtypes, functional impairments, and presumed time of injury in children in Uganda. Methods In this population-based study, we used a nested, three-stage, cross-sectional method (Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance System [HDSS]) to screen for cerebral palsy in children aged 2-17 years in a rural eastern Uganda district. A specialist team confirmed the diagnosis and determined the subtype, motor function (according to the Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS]), and possible time of brain injury for each child. Triangulation and interviews with key village informants were used to identify additional cases of suspected cerebral palsy. We estimated crude and adjusted cerebral palsy prevalence. We did chi(2) analyses to examine differences between the group screened at stage 1 and the entire population and regression analyses to investigate associations between the number of cases and age, GMFCS level, subtype, and time of injury. Findings We used data from the March 1, 2015, to June 30, 2015, surveillance round of the Iganga-Mayuge HDSS. 31 756 children were screened for cerebral palsy, which was confirmed in 86 (19%) of 442 children who screened positive in the first screening stage. The crude cerebral palsy prevalence was 2.7 (95% CI 2.2-3.3) per 1000 children, and prevalence increased to 2.9 (2.4-3.6) per 1000 children after adjustment for attrition. The prevalence was lower in older (8-17 years) than in younger (<8 years) children. Triangulation added 11 children to the cohort. Spastic unilateral cerebral palsy was the most common subtype (45 [46%] of 97 children) followed by bilateral cerebral palsy (39 [40%] of 97 children). 14 (27%) of 51 children aged 2-7 years had severe cerebral palsy (GMFCS levels 4-5) compared with only five (12%) of 42 children aged 8-17 years. Few children (two [2%] of 97) diagnosed with cerebral palsy were born preterm. Post-neonatal events were the probable cause of cerebral palsy in 24 (25%) of 97 children. Interpretation Cerebral palsy prevalence was higher in rural Uganda than in high-income countries (HICs), where prevalence is about 1.8-2.3 cases per 1000 children. Children younger than 8 years were more likely to have severe cerebral palsy than older children. Fewer older children than younger children with cerebral palsy suggested a high mortality in severely affected children. The small number of preterm-born children probably resulted from low preterm survival. About five times more children with post-neonatal cerebral palsy in Uganda than in HICs suggested that cerebral malaria and seizures were prevalent risk factors in this population.

This recommendation results in unnecessary Xpert MTB/RIF testing in many individuals living in tuberculosis-endemic areas and thus poor implementation of intensified case finding and tuberculosis preventive therapy. Novel approaches to tuberculosis screening are needed to help achieve global targets for tuberculosis elimination. We assessed the performance of C-reactive protein (CRP) measured with a point-of-care assay as a screening tool for active pulmonary tuberculosis. Methods For this prospective study, we enrolled adults (aged >= 18 years) living with HIV with CD4 cell count less than or equal to 350 cells per mu L who were initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) from two HIV/AIDS clinics in Uganda. CRP concentrations were measured at study entry with a point-of-care assay using whole blood obtained by fingerprick (concentration >= 10 mg/L defined as screen positive for tuberculosis). Sputum samples were collected for Xpert MTB/RIF testing and culture. We calculated the sensitivity and specificity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening in reference to culture results. We repeated the sensitivity analysis with Xpert MTB/RIF as the reference standard. Findings Between July 8, 2013, and Dec 15, 2015, 1237 HIV-infected adults were enrolled and underwent point-of-care CRP testing. 60 (5%) patients with incomplete or contaminated cultures were excluded from the analysis. Of the remaining 1177 patients (median CD4 count 165 cells per mu L [IQR 75-271]), 163 (14%) had culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Point-of-care CRP testing had 89% sensitivity (145 of 163, 95% CI 83-93) and 72% specificity (731 of 1014, 95% CI 69-75) for culture-confirmed tuberculosis. Compared with WHO symptom-based screening, point-of-care CRP testing had lower sensitivity (difference -7%, 95% CI -12 to -2; p=0.002) but substantially higher specificity (difference 58%, 95% CI 55 to 61; p<0.0001). When Xpert MTB/RIF results were used as the reference standard, sensitivity of point-of-care CRP and WHO symptom-based screening were similar (94% [79 of 84] vs 99% [83 of 84], respectively; difference -5%, 95% CI -12 to 2; p=0.10). Interpretation The performance characteristics of CRP support its use as a tuberculosis screening test for people living with HIV with CD4 count less than or equal to 350 cells per mu L who are initiating ART. HIV/AIDS programmes should consider point-of-care CRP-based tuberculosis screening to improve the efficiency of intensified case finding and increase uptake of tuberculosis preventive therapy.

However, there is a lack of international consensus on which outcome domains are most salient to monitor treatment progress and how they should be measured. The aim of this project was to propose (1) an essential set of outcome domains relevant across countries and cultures, (2) a set of easily accessible patient-reported instruments, and (3) a psychometric approach to make scores from different instruments comparable. Twenty-four experts, including ten health outcomes researchers, ten clinical experts from all continents, two patient advocates, and two ICHOM coordinators worked for seven months in a consensus building exercise to develop recommendations based on existing evidence using a structured consensus-driven modified Delphi technique. The group proposes to combine an assessment of potential outcome predictors at baseline (47 items: demographics, functional, clinical status, etc.), with repeated assessments of disease-specific symptoms during the treatment process (19 items: symptoms, side effects, etc.), and a comprehensive annual assessment of broader treatment outcomes (45 items: remission, absenteeism, etc.). Further, it is suggested reporting disease-specific symptoms for depression and anxiety on a standardized metric to increase comparability with other legacy instruments. All recommended instruments are provided online An international standard of health outcomes assessment has the potential to improve clinical decision making, enhance health care for the benefit of patients, and facilitate scientific knowledge.

It addresses the gap in existing data by analysing retention rates of surgical graduates by comparing graduating institution to current location. Data were assessed by country, region, specialty and gender with a view to informing national and regional healthcare and education strategies. Twenty-five institutions train surgeons in the ten countries covered by the College of Surgeons of East, Central and Southern Africa (COSECSA)-24 Universities and the College itself. These institutions were requested in November 2014 to supply details of graduates from their postgraduate surgical training programmes. Complete graduate lists were returned by the College and 14 universities by March 2016. These surgical graduates were compared against the database of current practising surgeons in the region held by COSECSA. Data were cross-checked against medical council registers, surgical society records, and with members and fellows of COSECSA. Data were incomplete for 126 surgical graduates. Of the remaining 1038 surgical graduates, 85.1% were retained in the country they trained in, while 88.3% were retained within the COSECSA region. Ninety-three per cent (93.4%) were retained within Africa. Of the eight countries, Malawi had the highest retention rate with 100% of surgical graduates remaining in country, while Zimbabwe had the lowest rate with 65.5% remaining. High surgical graduate retention rates across the region indicate that the expansion of national surgical training initiatives is an effective solution to addressing the surgical workforce shortage in East, Central and Southern Africa and counters long-held arguments regarding brain drain in this region.

Objective: This study sought to identify the key underlying causes of the persistently high stunting rates in a region of Uganda known to have low poverty rates and a high agricultural output. Methods: A matched case-control study was conducted in Buhweju district, southwest Uganda to compare prior exposures between stunted children (cases) and nonstunted children (controls). Results: The sample comprised 56 cases and 112 controls, totaling 168 children aged 6 to 59 months. There were almost equal numbers of boys and girls in the sample. Boys were significantly more likely to be stunted compared to girls (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.1-4.2; P < .05). Stunted children were significantly less likely to be introduced to complementary foods at an appropriate age and their primary caregivers lacked knowledge about stunting. The odds of stunting were 2.4 times greater for children in food-insecure households compared to those in food-secure households (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1-5.0; P < .05) and 4.5 times greater among children who resided in poor quality houses (OR: 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4-13.0; P < .05). Conclusion: Low access to appropriate complementary diets, sex of child, food insecurity, poor socioeconomic status, and low knowledge about stunting were the main predictors of childhood stunting in the study population.

PROMISE-EBF Study Grp	Assessing causal effects of early life-course factors on early childhood caries in 5-year-old Ugandan children using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs): A prospective cohort study	COMMUNITY DENTISTRY AND ORAL EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						ECC; epidemiology; paediatric dentistry; public health; statistics	DENTAL-CARIES; RISK-FACTORS; BACKGROUND FACTORS; HEALTH; PREVALENCE; DURATION; MALNUTRITION; ASSOCIATIONS; CONSUMPTION; NUTRITION	Objective: To estimate the effect of distal and proximal early life-course factors on early childhood caries (ECC) in 5-year-old Ugandan children, particularly focusing on the causal effect of exclusive breast feeding (EBF) on ECC using directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) for confounder selection. Methods: This study had a nested prospective cohort design, focusing on 5 years of follow-ups of caregiver-children pairs from the PROMISE-EBF trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no: NCT00397150) conducted in 2011 in Eastern Uganda. Data were from recruitment interviews, 24-week, 2-year and 5-year follow-ups of a cohort of 417 mother-children pairs. Trained research assistants performed interviews with caregivers in the local language and ECC was recorded under field conditions using the World Health Organization's (WHO) decayed missing or filled teeth (dmft) index. Early life-course factors in terms of socio-demographic characteristics, EBF and other feeding habits were assessed at the various follow-ups. The outcome (ECC; dmft>0) was assessed at the 5-year follow-up. Causal diagrams as DAGs were constructed to guide the selection of confounding and collider variables to be included in or excluded from the final multivariable analysis. Negative binomial regression analyses were performed based on two comparative DAGs representing different causal models. Results: Model 1 based on DAG 1, showed EBF to be a protective factor against ECC, with an IRR and 95% CI of 0.62 (0.43-0.91). According to Model 2 based on DAG 2, EBF and having both parents living together had protective effects: the corresponding IRRs and 95% CI were 0.60 (0.41-0.88) and 0.48 (0.25-0.90), respectively. Conclusions: Both plausible models indicated that being exclusively breastfed for 24 weeks had a protective causal effect against ECC. Further research, examining the unmeasured variables included in the DAGs is necessary to strengthen the present finding and allow stronger causal claims.

Molecular characterisation of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) accessions from Southwestern Uganda reveal high levels of genetic diversity	GENETIC RESOURCES AND CROP EVOLUTION			English	Article						Phaseolus vulgaris; Variety mixtures; Common bean gene pool; Farm saved variation; SSR; Phaseolin	LANDRACES; MARKERS; IDENTIFICATION; POLYMORPHISMS; COEVOLUTION; VARIABILITY; COLLECTION; STRATEGIES; SELECTION; MEXICO	Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) was introduced to East Africa over 400 years ago and is today a fundamental part of food and income security of many smallholder farmers in the region. East Africa is among the top three bean producing and consuming regions of Africa with Uganda, Rwanda and Kenya being leaders in production. The leading common bean producing region in Uganda is the Southwestern (SW) highlands. Production is subsistent and farmers grow mixed varieties (accessions) to minimize losses. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of farmer selection and production practices on genetic diversity of common bean in SW Uganda. 100 accessions were assembled from SW Uganda and assayed with 6 DNA simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. A total of 41 alleles were detected giving an overall average gene diversity of 0.299 (30%) in both districts. The accessions clustered into two major gene pools i.e., Mesoamerican and Andean. Within each gene pool there was evidence of clonal populations suggesting wide distribution of certain accessions. Kabale district had a higher average gene diversity (38%) compared to Kisoro district (22%). Detection of Andean phaseolin in a clone set of Mesoamerican gene pool suggests introgession between the two groups.

Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) as a bean intercrop or rotation crop contributes to the survival of bean root rot pathogens and perpetuation of bean root rots	PLANT PATHOLOGY			English	Article						Fusarium; incidence; intercropping; management; Pythium; severity	FUSARIUM; PYTHIUM	Root rots (RR) are the main cause of declining bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production in southwestern Uganda. Here, beans are mainly intercropped/rotated with maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), potatoes (Solanum tuberosum) and garden peas (Pisum sativum). These crops also suffer from RR and bean RR pathogens have been isolated from some of these crops. This study aimed to determine the extent of RR on maize, sorghum and peas, and their potential to contribute to the survival of bean RR pathogens. Therefore, experiments were carried out in bean RR-infested farmers' fields as well as soils inoculated with bean RR pathogens (Pythium spp. and Fusarium spp.) under screen house conditions and a susceptible bean cultivar served as a control. High RR incidence/severity scores were recorded in beans and sorghum in both farmers' fields and screen house experiments. The high field RR incidence/severity in sorghum correlated with the screen house scores. This study shows that RR is also a problem to other crops, especially sorghum, warranting attention. The findings also imply that sorghum plays a potential role as an alternate host to bean RR pathogens, increasing inoculum density of bean RR pathogens and potentially negatively impacting the bean RR problem. Intercropping or rotating beans with sorghum in this region is not recommended. However, maize was RR-resistant and therefore appropriate as an intercrop/rotational crop to beans in the system. A holistic rather than commodity approach is recommended for managing RR in this cropping system.

These defences are hypothesized to be negatively correlated due to either functional redundancy or a trade-off, i.e., plants which rely on increased mechanical defence should downregulate their degree of chemical defence and vice versa. A competing hypothesis is that different defences perform distinct functions and draw from different pools of resources, which should result in their independent evolution. We examine these competing hypotheses using two independent datasets of fleshy fruits we collected from Madagascar and Uganda. We sampled mechanical defences, indexed by fruit puncture resistance, and defensive defences, indexed by defensive volatile organic compounds, and examined their associations using phylogenetically-controlled models. In both systems, we found no correlation between mechanical and chemical defences, thus supporting the independent evolution hypothesis. This implies that fruit defence mechanisms reflect a more complex array of selection pressures and constraints than previously perceived.

We aimed to identify the determinants of raised blood pressure in urban Uganda to highlight targets for preventive interventions. Design: Case-control. Setting: Three community-based sites in Kampala, the capital of Uganda. Participants: Participants were eligible to enroll if they were aged >= 18 years and not pregnant. Methods: 450 cases with raised blood pressure were frequency matched by sex and age to 412 controls. Unconditional logistic regression was used to evaluate the association of socio-demographic, lifestyle, anthropometric, and laboratory variables with the outcome of raised blood pressure. Cases currently treated with antihypertensive medication and cases not treated with antihypertensive medication were analyzed separately. Results: Significantly increased odds of raised blood pressure were associated with overweight body mass index (BMI) (25 kg/m(2) <= BMI < 30 kg/m(2)), obese BMI (BMI >= 30 kg/m2) and hemoglobin A1c >= 6.5%. Significantly decreased odds of raised blood pressure were associated with moderate-to-vigorous work-related physical activity of >4 hours/week. No significant associations were found between raised blood pressure and marital status, education level, car or flush toilet ownership, dietary habits, alcohol consumption, smoking habits, moderate-to-vigorous leisure-related physical activity > 4 hours/week, waist-tohip ratio, or total cholesterol levels. Conclusions: Targeted interventions are needed to address the key modifiable risk factors for raised blood pressure identified in this study, namely elevated BMI and regular physical activity, in order to reduce the burden of cardiovascular disease in urban Uganda.

Cost-effectiveness of expanding childhood routine immunization against Neisseria meningitidis serogroups C, Wand Y with a quadrivalent conjugate vaccine in the African meningitis belt	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MENINGOCOCCAL MENINGITIS; GROUP-A; BACTERIAL-MENINGITIS; BURKINA-FASO; EPIDEMIC; NIGER; INFECTION; COUNTRIES; DISEASE	Background Neisseria meningitidis constitutes a major public health problem among countries in the African meningitis belt. Following regional vaccination campaigns for serogroup A and subsequent increases in protection against this serogroup, non-A serogroups such as C and W now pose significant epidemic threats, particularly in young children. Objective To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of broadening coverage from conjugate serogroup A to quadrivalent ACWY vaccination. Methods We developed a 40-year Markov state transition model with annual cycles to simulate costs and clinical outcomes in children aged 1 to 10 in the 26 countries of the African meningitis belt. The incidence of CWY meningitis cases among an unvaccinated population was held constant at inter-epidemic rates of 50 per 100,000/year and 150 per 100,000/year. The country-specific cost and probability of access to meningitis care, vaccine efficacy, the mortality risk among treated and untreated meningitis cases, the risk of clinical sequelae and their respective disability weights were based on published sources. Vaccination cost was based on international prices lists, presented in 2014 US$. Results At an incidence rate of 50 per 100,000/year, routine conjugate vaccination is highly costeffective in 14 out of 26 countries with a cost/DALY averted ranging from US$ 555-US$ 787. At the higher incidence rate of 150 per 100,000/year, quadrivalent vaccination is cost-effective in all 26 countries with a cost/DALY averted ranging from US$ 105-US$ 250. The annual incidence rate at which routine conjugate quadrivalent vaccination is expected to be economically justifiable ranges from 13 per 100,000/year in Nigeria to 142 per 100,000/year in Burundi. Conclusion Routine quadrivalent conjugate vaccination against Neisseria meningitidis is cost-effective at incidence rates well below the epidemic threshold among children living in the African meningitis belt.

Rakai Hlth Sciences Program	HIV Prevention Efforts and Incidence of HIV in Uganda	NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE			English	Article							ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; RAKAI; ACQUISITION; COVERAGE; PROGRESS; RISK; CARE	BACKGROUND To assess the effect of a combination strategy for prevention of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) on the incidence of HIV infection, we analyzed the association between the incidence of HIV and the scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and medical male circumcision in Rakai, Uganda. Changes in population-level viral-load suppression and sexual behaviors were also examined. METHODS Between 1999 and 2016, data were collected from 30 communities with the use of 12 surveys in the Rakai Community Cohort Study, an open, population-based cohort of persons 15 to 49 years of age. We assessed trends in the incidence of HIV on the basis of observed seroconversion data, participant-reported use of ART, participant-reported male circumcision, viral-load suppression, and sexual behaviors. RESULTS In total, 33,937 study participants contributed 103,011 person-visits. A total of 17,870 persons who were initially HIV-negative were followed for 94,427 person-years; among these persons, 931 seroconversions were observed. ART was introduced in 2004, and by 2016, ART coverage was 69% (72% among women vs. 61% among men, P<0.001). HIV viral-load suppression among all HIV-positive persons increased from 42% in 2009 to 75% by 2016 (P<0.001). Male circumcision coverage increased from 15% in 1999 to 59% by 2016 (P<0.001). The percentage of adolescents 15 to 19 years of age who reported never having initiated sex (i.e., delayed sexual debut) increased from 30% in 1999 to 55% in 2016 (P<0.001). By 2016, the mean incidence of HIV infection had declined by 42% relative to the period before 2006 (i.e., before the scale-up of the combination strategy for HIV prevention) - from 1.17 cases per 100 person-years to 0.66 cases per 100 person-years (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.45 to 0.76); declines were greater among men (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.73) than among women (adjusted incidence rate ratio, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.50 to 0.94). CONCLUSIONS In this longitudinal study, the incidence of HIV infection declined significantly with the scale-up of a combination strategy for HIV prevention, which provides empirical evidence that interventions for HIV prevention can have a population-level effect. However, additional efforts are needed to overcome disparities according to sex and to achieve greater reductions in the incidence of HIV infection.	[Grabowski, M. K.; Tobian, A. A.

Their occurrence in animal reservoirs and their susceptibilities to commonly used antimicrobials are poorly understood in developing countries. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence, determine antimicrobial susceptibility and identify risk factors associated with NTS presence in laying hen farms in Uganda through a cross-sectional study. Results: Pooled faecal samples were collected from 237 laying hen farms and these were analysed for NTS following standard laboratory procedures. In total, 49 farms (20.7%; 95% Confidence interval (CI): 15.6-25.6%) were positive for NTS presence. Altogether, ten Salmonella serotypes were identified among the confirmed 78 isolates, and the predominant serotypes were Salmonella Newport (30.8%), S. Hadar (14.1%), S. Aberdeen (12.8%), S. Heidelberg (12.8%), and S. Bolton (12. 8%). Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was detected in 45(57.7%) of the isolates and the highest resistance was against ciprofloxacin (50.0%) followed by sulphonamides (26.9%) and sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim (7.7%). Resistance was significantly associated with sampled districts (p = 0.034). Resistance to three or more drugs, multi-drug resistance (MDR) was detected in 12 (15.4%) of the isolates, 9 (75%) of these were from Wakiso district. A multivariable logistic model identified large farm size (OR = 7.0; 95% CI: 2.5-19.8) and the presence of other animal species on the farm (OR = 5.9; 95% CI: 2.1-16.1) as risk factors for NTS prevalence on farms. Having a separate house for birds newly brought to the farms was found to be protective (OR = 0,4; 95% CI: 0.2-0.8). Conclusion: This study has highlighted a high prevalence and diversity of NTS species in laying hen farms in Uganda and identified associated risk factors. In addition, it has demonstrated high levels of antimicrobial resistance in isolates of NTS. This could be because of overuse or misuse of antimicrobials in poultry production. Also importantly, the insights provided in this study justifies a strong case for strengthening One Health practices and this will contribute to the development of NTS control strategies at local, national and international levels.

J	Thomas, BF; Caineta, J; Nanteza, J				Thomas, Brian F.; Caineta, Julio; Nanteza, Jamiat			Global Assessment of Groundwater Sustainability Based On Storage Anomalies	GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article							CONTINENTAL WATER STORAGE; FOOD SECURITY; HIGH-PLAINS; GRACE; RESOURCES; DEPLETION; STRESS; DROUGHT; VULNERABILITY; RELIABILITY	The world's largest aquifers are a fundamental source of freshwater used for agricultural irrigation and to meet human water needs. Therefore, their stored volume of groundwater is linked with water security, which becomes more relevant during periods of drought. This work focuses on understanding large-scale groundwater changes, where we introduce an approach to evaluate groundwater sustainability at a global scale. We employ a groundwater drought index to assess performance metrics (reliability, resilience, vulnerability, and a combined sustainability index) for the largest and most productive global aquifers. Spatiotemporal changes in total water storage are derived from remote sensing observations of gravity anomalies, from which the groundwater drought index is inferred. The results reveal a complex relationship between the indicators, while considering monthly variability in groundwater storage. Combining the drought and sustainability indexes, as presented in this work, constitutes a measure for quantifying groundwater sustainability. This framework integrates changes in groundwater resources due to human influences and climate changes, thus opening a path to assess progress toward sustainable use and water security.

In developing countries like Uganda, are typically involved in undergraduate training. However, prior to this study there were no standard guidelines for this involvement. At the same time, the views and experiences of the graduate students in their role as educators had not been documented. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the views and experiences of graduate students about their involvement in undergraduate training in three Ugandan medical schools. The findings of this study will contribute to the development of policies for training in Ugandan medical schools. Methods: This was a qualitative study in which thirty in-depth-interviews were conducted among second and third year graduate students in three Ugandan medical schools in the MESAU consortium (Medical Education Services to all Ugandans) including Mbarara University of Science and Technology, Makerere College of Health Sciences and Kampala International University, Western Campus. Results: All graduate students from all the three medical schools viewed their involvement in undergraduate training as important. The study also revealed that graduate students increase available human resources and often compensate for the teaching missed when senior educators were absent. The graduate students expressed important views that need to be considered in the design of educational programs where they are to be involved. The respondents also reported a number of challenges in this undertaking that included lack of motivation, lack of orientation and having heavy workloads. The presence and commitment of senior educators to guide and support the graduate students in teaching activities was viewed as one significant intervention that would increase the effectiveness of their educational contributions. Conclusions: Graduate students enjoy their involvement in the training of undergraduate students despite the various challenges they face. In some departments, the involvement of postgraduate trainees is critical to the viability of undergraduate medical training.

Evaluation of outcomes for psychosis and epilepsy treatment delivered by primary health care workers in Nepal: a cohort study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						Evaluation; Community mental health; Primary health care; Psychosis; Epilepsy; low and middle income country; Nepal	DISORDERS	Background:Most evaluations of task-shifting have focused on common mental disorders. Much less work has been done on severe mental neurological and substance use (MNS) disorders, such as chronic psychosis and epilepsy. Given the high burden associated with severe MNS and the lack of mental health professionals in low and middle income countries, evaluations on the impact of task-shifting for these disorders are important. Methods:In a rural district of Nepal, a community mental health program, based on World Health Organization's Mental Health Gap Action Programme guidelines, was evaluated using a cohort study design. People with epilepsy and psychotic disorders were interviewed at treatment initiation and at 12-month follow-up. We also compared a group that was offered a comprehensive package of care (medication combined with psychosocial interventions, such as counselling and peer support groups) to a group that received medication only. Results:One-hundred nineteen persons were enrolled in the epilepsy cohort (EC) and 85 in the psychosis cohort (PC). The patients were enrolled in either the comprehensive package (n = 157) or medication only (n = 47). There was significant improvement (P < 0.0001) in psychosis symptoms (PC:Z = 6.78, r = 0.80) and depressive symptoms (EC:Z = 7.43, r = 0.73; PC:Z = 6.02, r = 0.70), seizures (EC:Z = 6.78), functional disability (EC:Z = 6.38, r = 0.67; PC: Z = 4.60, r = 0.57), family and caregiver burden (EC:Z = 8.09, r = 0.85; PC:Z = 6.81, r = 0.84), and social behaviour (PC:Z = 5.94, r = 0.84). There was greater risk reduction for recent seizures among people with epilepsy in the comprehensive treatment package vs. medication only (risk ratio = 0.52, 95% CI 0.29-0.95; P = 0.03); no other significant differences were observed between treatment arms. Conclusions:A community mental health program in Nepal, implemented by non-specialists, resulted in moderate to large effects among people with epilepsy or psychosis. A comprehensive package of care, including counselling and patient support groups, appears to offer added clinical benefits for patients with epilepsy. For people with psychosis, the basic package of care (i.e., psychotropic medications) performed similar to the comprehensive package, suggesting a less resource-intensive package may offer comparable results.

To this realisation, Uganda government set up an African trypanosomiasis (AT) control unit, which among other activities generates national tsetse control priority maps using apparent tsetse density data. Such maps underestimate mechanically transmitted AAT and thus ought to be refined using actual AT prevalence data. We therefore set out to generate up-to-date cattle and donkey trypanosomiasis prevalence data as well as find out the constraints to livestock production in Karamoja region in a bid to re-define AT control priority in this region. Results: Livestock keepers and animal health workers indicated that TBDs and AAT were the most important livestock diseases in Karamoja region. The prevalence of Trypanosoma spp. in cattle and donkeys was 16.3% (95% CI: 12.4-21.1%) and 32.4% (95% CI; 20.2-47.6%) respectively. Trypanosoma vivax (12.1%) and Trypanosoma congolense savannah (29.6%) were the most prevalent Trypanosoma spp. in cattle and donkeys respectively. Majority of the cattle (85.7%) and more than half of the donkey (57.1%) herds were positive for Trypanosoma spp. Conclusions: African animal trypanosomiasis and TBDs are the most important constraints to livestock production in Karamoja region. In order to improve livestock production and hence Karamajong livelihoods, government of Uganda and her development partners will need to invest in livestock health programs particularly targeting tsetse and TBD control.

These analytes, when used together, may also have the potential to differentiate active pulmonary TB (APTB) from latent TB infection (LTBI). However, few studies have explored the use of QFT-GIT supernatants for investigations of antibody responses. This study determined the correlation and agreement between anti-CFP-10 and anti-ESAT-6 antibody concentrations in QFT-GIT nil supernatant and serum pairs from 68 TB household contacts. We also explored the ability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) specific antibodies, or ratios of antibody to interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) in QFT-GIT supernatants, to differentiate 97 APTB cases from 58 individuals with LTBI. Sputum smear microscopy was used to define APTB, whereas the QFT-GIT and tuberculin skin test were used to define LTBI. There were strong and statistically significant correlations between anti-CFP-10 and anti-ESAT-6 antibodies in unstimulated QFT-GIT supernatants and sera (r = 0.89; p<0.0001 for both), and no significant differences in antibody concentration between them. Anti-CFP-10 & anti-ESAT-6 antibodies differentiated APTB from LTBI with sensitivities of 88.7% & 71.1% and specificities of 41.4% & 51.7% respectively. Anti-CFP-10 antibody/M. tb specific IFN-gamma and anti-ESAT-6 antibody/M. tb specific IFN-gamma ratios had sensitivities of 48.5% & 54.6% and specificities of 89.7% and 75.9% respectively. We conclude that QFT-GIT nil supernatants may be used in the place of sera when measuring antibody responses, reducing blood volumes needed for such investigations. Antibodies in QFT-GIT nil supernatants on their own discriminate APTB from LTBI with high sensitivity but have poor specificity, whereas the reverse is true when antibodies are used in combination withM. tb specific cytokines. Further antibody and antibody/cytokine combinations need to be explored to achieve better diagnostic accuracy.

Alkaline peptone water enrichment with a dipstick test to quickly detect and monitor cholera outbreaks	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Vibrio cholerae; Rapid test; Dipstick; Alkaline peptone water; RDT; Outbreak detection; Epidemic monitoring	RAPID DIAGNOSTIC-TESTS; UGANDA; AFRICA; EPIDEMIOLOGY	Background: Detection, confirmation and monitoring of cholera outbreaks in many developing countries including Uganda is a big challenge due to lack of the required resources and the time the test takes. Culture method which takes 24-48 h to get the feedback and requires highly skilled laboratory staff plus other complex resources is the standard test. This study evaluated the new cholera rapid detection method that relies on Crystal VC dipsticks after enrichment with alkaline peptone water (APW) against the culture method for monitoring the progress of cholera outbreaks in rural setting. Methods: We conducted the study between March and June 2015. Fresh stool samples and rectal swabs were incubated in 1% APW for 6 h at room temperature before testing with RDT following the manufacturer's instruction. The same stool sample was cultured to isolate V. cholerae in the standard manner. We also reviewed patient registers to epidemiologically describe the cholera epidemic. Results: We tested stool from 102 consenting suspected cholera patients reporting during daytime at Bwera Hospital (n = 69), Kilembe Mines Hospital (n = 4) and Kinyabwama Health Centre (n = 29). Ninety one (91) samples were positive and nine samples were negative according to both methods. One (1) sample was positive only by dipstick and one sample was positive only by culture (sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 90%, Positive Predictive Value of 99% and Negative Predictive Value of 90%). Overall, 146 suspected cholera cases and two deaths, (case fatality rate of 1.36%) were recorded during the study period. Among the cases aged 1-9 years, 63% (50/79) were males while in those aged 20-49 years, 76% (34/45) were females. Conclusions: Our findings showed that the modified dipstick test after enrichment with 1% APW had high level of accuracy in detection of V. cholerae and is quick, affordable alternative cholera outbreak monitoring tool in resource constrained settings. However, culture method should remain for cholera epidemic confirmation, for monitoring of antibiotic sensitivity and for production of pure isolates for molecular characterization. Further studies should be done to better understand the observed age and sex case distribution, in Kasese district.

Elevated Aspergillus-specific antibody levels among HIV infected Ugandans with pulmonary tuberculosis	BMC PULMONARY MEDICINE			English	Article						Aspergillosis; HIV; Tuberculosis; Fungal diagnostics; serology	ALLERGIC BRONCHOPULMONARY ASPERGILLOSIS; IMMUNOGLOBULIN-E; IGE LEVELS; PREVALENCE; DISEASE; AFRICAN; ASTHMA	Background: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is high among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected Ugandans. Recent evidence suggests that Chronic Pulmonary Aspergillosis and Aspergillus sensitisation might be responsible for significant mortality in patients treated for tuberculosis in Uganda. Methods: We retrieved and tested paired serum aliquots for 101 HIV-TB co-infected patients at the beginning and week 24 of TB treatment. We tested samples for Aspergillus-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin E (IgE) using ImmunoCAP (R); and Aspergillus-specific IgG and total serum IgE using Immulite (R) immunoassays. We compared antibody levels between baseline and week 24, relating them to selected baseline characteristics. Results: 10% of the patients had elevated Aspergillus-specific IgE (Aspergillus sensitization) and Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies were elevated in 9% of the patients at the end of TB treatment. There was a significant fall in the Aspergillus-specific IgG antibody levels between baseline and week 24 (P = 0.02). Patients with cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) T-cell count < 100 cells/mu l and those who were not on anti-retroviral therapy at baseline had more elevated Aspergillus-specific IgG antibodies (P = 0.01, P = 0.03). The ImmunoCAP (R) Aspergillus-specific IgG antibody titres were higher at week 24 than baseline with more positives at week 24; even though the difference in means was small. However, this difference was statistically significant (P = 0.02). Pulmonary infiltrates were the commonest x-ray abnormality and only 5% of the patients had pulmonary cavities on chest x-ray at week 24. Conclusion: These results suggest that Aspergillus infection may complicate active pulmonary TB and further studies including fungal culture and thoracic imaging may now be indicated to measure the prevalence of pulmonary aspergillosis complicating tuberculosis.

As a result many of these countries still have unacceptably high maternal and neonatal mortality rates. Recent data at the national referral hospitals in East Africa reported that none of the national referral hospitals met the World Federation of Societies of Anesthesiologists (WFSA) international standards required to provide safe obstetric anaesthesia (Epiu I: Challenges of Anesthesia in Low-and Middle-Income Countries. WFSA; 2014 http://wfsa. newsweaver. com/Newsletter/p8c8ta4ri7a1 wsacct9y3u?a = 2& p = 47730565& t = 27996496). In spite of this evidence, factors contributing to maternal mortality related to anaesthesia in LMICs and the magnitude of these issues have not been comprehensively studied. We therefore set out to assess regional referral, district, private for profit and private not-for profit hospitals in Uganda. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey at 64 government and private hospitals in Uganda using pre-set questionnaires to the anaesthetists and hospital directors. Access to the minimum requirements for safe obstetric anaesthesia according to WFSA guidelines were also checked using a checklist for operating and recovery rooms. Results: Response rate was 100% following personal interviews of anaesthetists, and hospital directors. Only 3 of the 64 (5%) of the hospitals had all requirements available to meet the WFSA International guidelines for safe anaesthesia. Additionally, 54/64 (84%) did not have a trained physician anaesthetist and 5/64 (8%) had no trained providers for anaesthesia at all. Frequent shortages of drugs were reported for regional/neuroaxial anaesthesia, and other essential drugs were often lacking such as antacids and antihypertensives. We noted that many of the anaesthesia machines present were obsolete models without functional safety alarms and/or mechanical ventilators. Continuous ECG was only available in 3/64 (5%) of hospitals. Conclusion: We conclude that there is a significant lack of essential equipment for the delivery of safe anaesthesia across this region. This is compounded by the shortage of trained providers and inadequate supervision. It is therefore essential to strengthen anaesthesia services by addressing these specific deficiencies. This will include improved training of associate clinicians, training more physician anaesthetists and providing the basic equipment required to provide safe and effective care. These services are key components of comprehensive emergency obstetric care and anaesthetists are crucial in managing critically ill mothers and ensuring good surgical outcomes.

Metabolic Profiling of Central Nervous System Disease in Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense Infection	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Human African trypanosomiasis; CNS; neurological symptoms; metabolic profiling; nuclear magnetic resonance	HUMAN AFRICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS; HUMAN CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; ANALYTICAL REPRODUCIBILITY; H-1-NMR SPECTROSCOPY; METABONOMICS; BRAIN; MENINGITIS; DIAGNOSIS; RESPONSES; HOST	Background. The progression of human African trypanosomiasis from the early hemolymphatic stage to the late meningoen-cephalitic stage is of critical diagnostic importance as it determines the choice of potentially toxic drug regimens. Current diagnostic criteria involving analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for parasites and/or pleocytosis are sensitive, but recent evidence suggests that specificity may be poor. Methods. We used an untargeted global metabolic profiling approach for the discovery of novel candidate stage-diagnostic markers in CSF from patients infected with Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, using H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Results. Metabolic markers did not distinguish between early and late-stage cases but were associated with neuroinflammatory responses and the presentation of neurological disturbances. In particular, increased concentrations of 3-hydroxybutyrate and alanine and reduced concentrations of mannose and urea were discriminatory for the presentation of daytime somnolence and gait ataxia. Conclusions. CSF metabolite concentrations provide markers for neuroinflammatory responses during central nervous system (CNS) invasion by trypanosomes and are associated with the presentation of neurological disturbances independently of disease stage determined by current criteria. This suggests that applying a dichotomous-stage diagnosis on the basis of CSF pleocytosis does not accurately reflect the biological changes occurring as parasites invade the CNS and has implications for biomarker discovery strategies.

The northern part of Kibale National Park, a mid-altitude rainforest in western Uganda, is largely surrounded by industrial tea plantations and wildlife using this area (Sebitoli) must cope with proximity to human populations and their activities. The chimpanzees and baboons in this area raid crops (primarily maize) in neighboring gardens. Sixteen young individuals of the 66 chimpanzees monitored (25%) exhibit abnormalities including reduced nostrils, cleft lip, limb deformities, reproductive problems and hypopigmentation. Each pathology could have a congenital component, potentially exacerbated by environmental factors. In addition, at least six of 35 photographed baboons from a Sebitoli troop (17%) have similar severe nasal deformities. Our inquiries in villages and tea factories near Sebitoli revealed use of eight pesticides (glyphosate, cypermethrin, profenofos, mancozeb, metalaxyl, dimethoate, chlorpyrifos and 2,4-D amine). Chemical analysis of samples collected from 2014 to 2016 showed that mean levels of pesticides in fresh maize stems and seeds, soils, and river sediments in the vicinity of the chimpanzee territory exceed recommended limits. Notably, excess levels were found for total DDT and its metabolite pp'-DDE and for chlorpyrifos in fresh maize seeds and in fish from Sebitoli. Imidacloprid was detected in coated maize seeds planted at the edge the forest and in fish samples from the Sebitoli area, while no pesticides were detected in fish from central park areas. Since some of these pesticides are thyroid hormone disruptors, we postulate that excessive pesticide use in the Sebitoli area may contribute to facial dysplasia in chimpanzees and baboons through this endocrine pathway. Chimpanzees are considered as endangered by IUCN and besides their intrinsic value and status as closely related to humans, they have major economic value in Uganda via ecotourism. Identifying and limiting potential threats to their survival such be a conservation priority. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Due to the paucity of data on supplement use, this study aimed to determine the proportion of Ugandan athletes using nutritional supplements and to investigate the athletes' motivation to use these supplements. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in which an interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 359 professional athletes participating in individual (boxing, cycling, athletics) and team (basketball, rugby, football, netball, and volleyball) sports. The data were categorized, and a Chi-square test was used for statistical analysis. Results: Of the 359 athletes, 48 (13.4%) used nutritional supplements. Carbohydrate supplements, energy drinks, vitamin and mineral supplements, fish oils, and protein supplements were the most common supplements used by athletes. NS use was significantly more common among athletes who played rugby and basketball (X-2 = 61.101, p < 0.0001), athletes who had played the sport for 5-10 years (X-2 = 7.460, p = 0.024), and athletes who had attained a tertiary education (X-2 = 33.377, p < 0.0001). The athletes' occupation had no bearing on whether they used supplements. Nutritionists/dieticians, retail stores and pharmacies were the most common sources of NS products, whereas health practitioners, online media and teammates were the most common sources of information regarding NS. Most athletes used NS to improve their physical performance and health. Conclusions: Compared to NS use by athletes elsewhere, NS use among Ugandan athletes was low. However, determinants of athlete NS use in the current study (category of sport and duration of time spent playing the sport) are similar to those reported elsewhere.

Lucian			A complex intervention to improve implementation of World Health Organization guidelines for diagnosis of severe illness in low-income settings: a quasi-experimental study from Uganda	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article						Implementation; Quality improvement; Critical care; Africa South of the Sahara; Uganda; Global health	GLASGOW COMA SCALE; CRITICAL-CARE; EMERGENCY CARE; SEVERE SEPSIS; VITAL SIGNS; MORTALITY; COUNTRIES; CONSCIOUSNESS; MANAGEMENT; SERVICES	Background: To improve management of severely ill hospitalized patients in low-income settings, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a triage tool called "Quick Check" to provide clinicians with a rapid, standardized approach to identify patients with severe illness based on recognition of abnormal vital signs. Despite the availability of these guidelines, recognition of severe illness remains challenged in low-income settings, largely as a result of infrequent vital sign monitoring. Methods: We conducted a staggered, pre-post quasi-experimental study at four inpatient health facilities in western Uganda to assess the impact of a multi-modal intervention for improving quality of care following formal training on WHO "Quick Check" guidelines for diagnosis of severe illness in low-income settings. Intervention components were developed using the COM-B ("capability," "opportunity," and "motivation" determine "behavior") model and included clinical mentoring by an expert in severe illness care, collaborative improvement meetings with external support supervision, and continuous audits of clinical performance with structured feedback. Results: There were 5759 patients hospitalized from August 2014 to May 2015: 1633 were admitted before and 4126 during the intervention period. Designed to occur twice monthly, collaborative improvement meetings occurred every 2-4 weeks at each site. Clinical mentoring sessions, designed to occur monthly, occurred every 4-6 months at each site. Audit and feedback reports were implemented weekly as designed. During the intervention period, there were significant increases in the site-adjusted likelihood of initial assessment of temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, mental status, and pulse oximetry. Patients admitted during the intervention period were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with sepsis (4.3 vs. 0.4%, risk ratio 10.1, 95% CI 3.0-31.0, p < 0.001) and severe respiratory distress (3.9 vs. 0.9%, risk ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.8-10.9, p = 0.001). Conclusions: Theory-informed quality improvement programs can improve vital sign collection and diagnosis of severe illness in low-income settings. Further implementation, evaluation, and scale-up of such interventions are needed to enhance hospital-based triage and severe illness management in these settings.

Objective To apply a cascade analysis to implementation of household contact investigation in a programmatic setting. Design Prospective, multi-center observational study. Methods We constructed a cascade for household contact investigation to describe the proportions of: 1) index patient households recruited; 2) index patient households visited; 3) contacts screened for TB; and 4) contacts completing evaluation for, and diagnosed with, active TB. Results 338 (33%) of 1022 consecutive index TB patients were eligible for contact investigation. Lay health workers scheduled home visits for 207 (61%) index patients and completed 104 (50%). Among 287 eligible contacts, they screened 256 (89%) for symptoms or risk factors for TB. 131 (51%) had an indication for further TB evaluation. These included 59 (45%) with symptoms alone, 58 (44%) children < 5, and 14 (11%) with HIV. Among 131 contacts found to be symptomatic or at risk, 26 (20%) contacts completed evaluation, including five (19%) diagnosed with and treated for active TB, for an overall yield of 1.7%. The cumulative conditional probability of completing the entire cascade was 5%. Conclusion Major opportunities exist for improving the effectiveness and yield of TB contact investigation by increasing the proportion of index households completing screening visits by lay health workers and the proportion of at-risk contacts completing TB evaluation.

As trypanosomes that cause animal African trypanosomiasis (AAT) also express related antigens, we have evaluated two rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) on cattle in trypanosomiasis endemic and non-endemic regions, to determine whether gHAT serological tests could also be used to screen for AAT. Methods: Two RDTs, 1G RDT, made with native antigens, and p2G RDT, made with recombinant antigens, were tested on 121 cattle in a trypanosomiasis-free region, and on 312 cattle from a rhodesiense HAT and AAT endemic region. A subset of samples from the endemic region were also tested with two immune trypanolysis (TL) tests. The sensitivity of the tests was estimated by evaluating the result of the RDT on samples that were positive by both microscopy and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR, whilst specificity was the result of the RDT on samples that were negative by ITS PCR and microscopy, and others from the non-endemic region. Results: The specificity of the p2G RDT on cattle from the non-endemic region was 97.5% (95% CI: 93.0-99.2%), compared to only 57.9% (95% CI: 48.9-66.3%) for 1G RDT. The specificities of 1G RDT, p2G RDT and TL on endemic control cattle were 14.6% (95% CI: 9.7-21.5%), 22.6% (95% CI: 16.4-30.3%) and 68.3% (95% CI: 59.6-75.9%), respectively. The sensitivities of the tests on trypanosome positive samples were 85.1% (95% CI: 79.1-89.7%), 89.1% (95% CI: 83.7-93.0%) and 59.3% (95% CI: 51.8-66.4%), respectively. Among the same samples, 51.7% were positive by both TL and the 1G RDT. Conclusions: These serological tests detect cross-reacting antibodies in cattle. The p2G RDT based on recombinant antigens had a high specificity in a non-endemic region, while the 1G RDT had a lower specificity, suggesting cross-reactivity with other pathogens.

A laboratory-scale centrifuge was applied to dewater FS from lined pit latrines, conditioned with sawdust and charcoal dust. Response surface methodology and central composite design were used to construct and model relationships between independent variables (FS volume, centrifugation time and speed) and the dependent variable (per cent cake solids) for unconditioned and conditioned (sawdust and charcoal dust) FS. The results demonstrated that the centrifugation technology can yield more per cent cake solids at reduced speeds when physically conditioned. Rotational speed was a significant parameter for unconditioned (original) (p = 0.0020) and charcoal dust conditioned FS (p = 0.0019). Significant parameters for sawdust conditioned FS were speed (p = 0.0001) and quadratic effect of time (p = 0.0494). An optimal centrifugation time of 20 minutes and centrifugation container volume of 50 mL at 70-80% full of FS for conditioned FS were obtained. The centrifugation speeds tested in this paper provide critical information for proto-type design of a hand-powered centrifuge, the operating conditions and its subsequent set-up. This can serve as an option for dewatering FS from commonly used sanitation facilities in urban slums, thereby enabling decentralised treatment to reduce costs of FS management and support resource recovery at the source.

We separately delivered these 2 components in a cluster-randomized controlled trial to evaluate their comparative effectiveness in promoting healthy child development and caregiver mental health. This is the first study to do so for HIV-affected children and their infected mothers. Methods: Two hundred twenty-one HIV-exposed but uninfected child (2-3 years old) and caregiver dyads in 18 geographic clusters in Eastern Uganda were randomized by cluster to receive biweekly individualized sessions of either (1) Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers (MISC) training emphasizing cognitive stimulation or (2) Uganda Community Based Association for Child Welfare (UCOBAC) program that delivered health and nutrition training. Children were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 1 year (training conclusion), and 1-year posttraining with the Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), the Color-Object Association Test for memory, the Early Childhood Vigilance Test of attention, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF-parent). The Caldwell Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment (HOME) was completed by observers to gauge caregiving quality after training. Caregiver depression/anxiety (Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25) and functionality (list of activities of daily living) were also evaluated. Data collectors were blinded to trial arm assignment. Results: Mediational Intervention for Sensitizing Caregivers resulted in significantly better quality of caregiving compared with UCOBAC midintervention with an adjusted mean difference (M-adjDiff) of 2.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.54-3.15, p<.01), postintervention (M-adjDiff = 2.43, 95% CI: 1.61-3.25, p<.01), and at 1-year follow-up (M-adjDiff = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.23-2.90, p<.01). MISC caregivers reported more problems on the BRIEF for their child at 1-year posttraining only (p<.01). Caregiving quality (HOME) was significantly correlated with MSEL composite performance 1-year posttraining for both the MISC and the UCOBAC trial arms. Likewise, physical growth was significantly related to child development outcomes even though it did not differ between trial arms. Conclusion: Even though MISC demonstrated an advantage of improving caregiving quality, it did not produce better child cognitive outcomes compared with health and nutrition training.

We evaluated 15 common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) varieties in a split-plot design under two fertilizer regimes, for two seasons, and in six locations in Rakai and Hoima districts, Uganda. We assessed VEI and VMI effects on plant vigor, plant height, number of pods per plant, grain yield, and reaction to angular leaf spot (ALS) (Psuedocercospra griseola), common bean rust (CBR), common bacterial blight (CBB) (Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli), and anthracnose on pods (ANTP) (Colletotrichum linemuthianum) under field conditions. The seasons and fertilizer levels were considered as separate environments resulting in 24 environments. Variety x location x season interaction had a significant effect on the reaction to ALS, CBR, and grain yield. The VEI and VMI analysis grouped the 12 environments into two mega-environments based on grain yield in different seasons and fertilizer levels. ROBA1, MasindiYellow Long, and NABE2 varieties had the highest grain yield in the different mega-environments. The Farmers' variety and varieties KATX69 and KATX56 were stable, whereas NABE2, RWR719, and ROBA1 were unstable in grain yield performance. Genotypic correlations between traits were stronger in Hoima than in Rakai. The diseases correlated negatively with grain yield, and were strong in the second season of Hoima district. The Katumani varieties and landraces were susceptible to disease in the environments. Th us, increased production of landraces, KATX69 and KATX56 could be attained by improving their disease resistance.

This study investigated the genetic basis of phenotypic resistance against SP in R. (B.) decoloratus and sought to identify novel diagnostic mutations for rapid detection of SP resistance in the above tick species. Genomic DNA was extracted from pooled larvae of 20 tick populations (19 of known SP susceptibility and 1 unknown susceptibility). The voltage sensitive sodium channel (VSSC) domain II S4-5 linker (SP target) and partial carboxylesterase (SP metabolizing enzyme) genes were amplified by PCR, cloned and sequenced. The resultant sequences were analyzed to determine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with phenotypic resistance in the various tick populations investigated. Novel SNPs that introduced Eco RI and Eco RII restriction sites in carboxylesterase gene were identified in silco and validated with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) against 18 tick populations of known SP susceptibility. The study identified a super knock down resistance (kdr) mutation T58C in R. (B.) decoloratus VSSC associated with stable SP resistance. We further identified multiple nonsynonymous mutations in carboxylesterase of SP resistant ticks; one of which conferred novel EcoRII (G195C) restriction site for PCR-RFLP detection of SP resistance. In conclusion, this study is the first to report super kdr mutation in sodium channel domain II and multiple mutations in carboxylesterase genes that may concurrently mediate stable resistance against synthetic pyrethroids in R. (B.) decoloratus ticks from Uganda. The Eco RII based PCR-RFLP is a useful tool for rapid detection of stable SP resistant R. (B.) decoloratus ticks.

Evaluating the Causal Link Between Malaria Infection and Endemic Burkitt Lymphoma in Northern Uganda: A Mendelian Randomization Study	EBIOMEDICINE			English	Article						Burkitt Lymphoma; Malaria; Plasmodium falciparum; Mendelian randomization; Sickle cell trait; Malaria resistance genes	SICKLE-CELL TRAIT; EPSTEIN-BARR-VIRUS; FALCIPARUM-MALARIA; GENOME-WIDE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; TRANSMISSION; ASSOCIATION; ANTIBODIES; CHILDREN	Background: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria infection is suspected to cause endemic Burkitt Lymphoma (eBL), but the evidence remains unsettled. An inverse relationship between sickle cell trait (SCT) and eBL, which supports that between malaria and eBL, has been reported before, but in small studies with low power. We investigated this hypothesis in children in a population-based study in northern Uganda using Mendelian Randomization. Methods: Malaria-related polymorphisms (SCT, IL10, IL1A, CD36, SEMA3C, and IFNAR1) were genotyped in 202 eBL cases and 624 controls enrolled during 2010-2015. We modeled associations between genotypes and eBL or malaria using logistic regression. Findings: SCT was associated with decreased risk of eBL (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.37, 95% CI 0.21-0.66; p = 0.0003). Decreased risk of eBL was associated with IL10 rs1800896-CT (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.50-1.07) and -CC genotypes (OR 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.95, p(trend) = 0.019); IL1A rs2856838-AG (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.39-0.81) and -AA genotype (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.28-1.01, p(trend) = 0.0016); and SEMA3C rs4461841-CT or -CC genotypes (OR 0.57, 95% CI 0.35-0.93, p = 0.0193). SCT and IL10 rs1800896, IL1A rs2856838, but not SEMA3C rs4461841, polymorphisms were associated with decreased risk of malaria in the controls. Interpretation: Our results support a causal effect of malaria infection on eBL.

The aim of this study was to estimate the seroprevalence of L. interrogans Icterohaemorrhagiae, Pomona, L. kirschneri Butembo, Grippotyphosa, L. borgpetersenii Nigeria, Hardjo, Wolfii, and Kenya and an overall seroprevalence in cattle from Kole and Mbale districts. Two hundred-seventy five bovine sera from 130 small holder farms from Kole (n = 159) and Mbale (n = 116), collected between January and July 2015, were tested for antibodies against eight Leptospira strains by Microscopic Agglutination Test. A titer of >= 100 was considered seropositive, indicating past exposure. Overall, the seroprevalence was 19.27% (95% CI 14.9-24.5%). Pomona seroprevalence was highest with 9.45% (6.4-13.7%), followed by Kenya 5.09% (2.9-8.6%), Nigeria 4.00% (2.1-7.2%), Wolfii 3.27% (1.6-6.3%), Butembo 1.86% (0.7-4.4%), Hardjo 1.45% (0.5-3.9%), and Icterohaemorragiae and Grippotyphosa with less than 1% positive. Seroprevalence did not differ between districts and gender (p >= 0.05). Seven animals had titers >= 400. Cross-reactions or exposure to >= 1 serovar was measured in 43% of serum samples. Seroprevalence of 19% implies exposure of cattle to leptospires.

Learning from four fragile and conflict-affected health systems in Uganda, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Cambodia	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Health workers; resilience; conflict; economic shocks; Ebola; coping strategies; Sierra Leone; Zimbabwe; Uganda; Cambodia	POST-CONFLICT; LESSONS; RESILIENCE; SERVICES	This article is grounded in a research programme which set out to understand how to rebuild health systems post-conflict. Four countries were studied-Uganda, Sierra Leone, Zimbabwe and Cambodia-which were at different distances from conflict and crisis, as well as having unique conflict stories. During the research process, the Ebola epidemic broke out in West Africa. Zimbabwe has continued to face a profound economic crisis. Within our research on health worker incentives, we captured insights from 128 life histories and in-depth interviews with a variety of staff that had remained in service. This article aims to draw together lessons from these contexts which can provide lessons for enhancing staff and therefore health system resilience in future, especially in similarly fragile and conflict-affected contexts. We examine the reported effects, both personal and professional, of the three different types of shock (conflicts, epidemics and prolonged political-economic crises), and how staff coped. We find that the impact of shocks and coping strategies are similar between conflict/post-conflict and epidemic contexts-particularly in relation to physical threats and psychosocial threats-while all three contexts create challenges and staff responses for working conditions and remuneration. Health staff showed considerable inventiveness and resilience, and also benefited from external assistance of various kinds, but there are important gaps which point to ways in which they should be better protected and supported in the future. Health systems are increasingly fragile and conflict-prone, and shocks are often prolonged or repeated. Resilience should not be taken for granted or used as an excuse for abandoning frontline health staff. Strategies should be in place at local, national and international levels to prepare for predictable crises of various sorts, rather than waiting for them to occur and responding belatedly, or relying on personal sacrifices by staff to keep services functioning.

The study builds upon work undertaken by PERFORM Research Consortium in Uganda using action-research to strengthen human resources management in the health sector. To assess the decision space that managers have in six areas of HRM (e.g. policy, planning, remuneration and incentives, performance management, education and information) the study compares the roles allocated by Uganda's policy and regulatory frameworks with the actual room for decision-making that district health managers perceive that they have. Results show that in some areas District Health Management Team (DHMT) members make decisions beyond their conferred authority while in others they do not use all the space allocated by policy. DHMT members operate close to the boundaries defined by public policy in planning, remuneration and incentives, policy and performance management. However, they make decisions beyond their conferred authority in the area of information and do not use all the space allocated by policy in the area of education. DHMTs' decision-making capacity to manage their workforce is influenced by their own perceived authority and sometimes it is constrained by decisions made at higher levels. We can conclude that decentralization, to improve workforce performance, needs to devolve power further down from district authorities onto district health managers. DHMTs need not only more power and authority to make decisions about their workforce but also more control over resources to be able to implement these decisions.

Safety and Immunogenicity of PENNVAX-G DNA Prime Administered by Biojector 2000 or CELLECTRA Electroporation Device With Modified Vaccinia Ankara-CMDR Boost	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						HIV vaccine; modified vaccinia Ankara; electroporation; needle-free injection	PREVENT HIV-1 INFECTION; VIRUS-LIKE PARTICLES; T-CELL RESPONSES; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; EFFICACY TRIAL; DOUBLE-BLIND; CLADE-B; MVA; VACCINATION; ENVELOPE	Background. We report the first-in-human safety and immunogenicity evaluation of PENNVAX-G DNA/modified vaccinia Ankara-Chiang Mai double recombinant (MVA-CMDR) prime-boost human immuonodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine, with intramuscular DNA delivery by either Biojector 2000 needle-free injection system (Biojector) or CELLECTRA electroporation device. Methods. Healthy, HIV-uninfected adults were randomized to receive 4 mg of PENNVAX-G DNA delivered intramuscularly by Biojector or electroporation at baseline and week 4 followed by intramuscular injection of 10(8) plaque forming units of MVA-CMDR at weeks 12 and 24. The open-label part A was conducted in the United States, followed by a double-blind, placebo-controlled part B in East Africa. Solicited and unsolicited adverse events were recorded, and immune responses were measured. Results. Eighty-eight of 100 enrolled participants completed all study injections, which were generally safe and well tolerated, with more immediate, but transient, pain in the electroporation group. Cellular responses were observed in 57% of vaccine recipients tested and were CD4 predominant. High rates of binding antibody responses to CRF01_AE antigens, including gp70 V1 V2 scaffold, were observed. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in a peripheral blood mononuclear cell assay, and moderate antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity activity was demonstrated. Discussion. The PVG/MVA-CMDR HIV-1 vaccine regimen is safe and immunogenic. Substantial differences in safety or immunogenicity between modes of DNA delivery were not observed.

MTN-020 ASPIRE Study Team	Implementation of a Novel Adherence Monitoring Strategy in a Phase III, Blinded, Placebo-Controlled, HIV-1 Prevention Clinical Trial	JAIDS-JOURNAL OF ACQUIRED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY SYNDROMES			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Conference on HIV Research for Prevention (HIV R4P)	OCT 17-20, 2016	Chicago, IL			HIV-1; adherence; dapivirine; women; pre-exposure prophylaxis; microbicide; intravaginal ring	ANTIRETROVIRAL PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; DAPIVIRINE VAGINAL RING; AFRICAN WOMEN; SAFETY; INFECTION; TENOFOVIR; PHARMACOKINETICS; ACCEPTABILITY; DISCLOSURE; DELIVERY	Background: Placebo-controlled HIV-1 prevention trials of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) have not generally used concurrent measurement of adherence because of the potential risk of unblinding. However, several pre-exposure prophylaxis trials for HIV-1 prevention among women failed to show effectiveness because of low product adherence. Evaluation of product adherence objectively during a study provides the opportunity for strengthening adherence activities at sites having low adherence. Methods: During MTN-020/ASPIRE, a phase III, placebo-controlled trial of the dapivirine intravaginal ring, we implemented an adherence monitoring system. Monitoring began in quarter 1 (Q1) 2013 and continued through the conclusion of the trial. Blood plasma was collected quarterly and tested for dapivirine concentrations while maintaining blinding among study team members involved in participant management. Dapivirine concentrations >95 pg/mL, reflecting >8 hours of continuous use, were assessed as signaling product use. Study leadership monitored results on a monthly basis and provided feedback to site investigators. Experiences were shared across sites to motivate staff and counsel participants to strive toward higher adherence levels. Results: An upward trend in adherence was observed (P < 0.0001); the proportion of samples from subjects in the active arm with dapivirine >95 pg/mL increased from 63% in Q1 2013 to 84% by Q1 2015. Conclusions: Ongoing drug level testing as a marker of adherence in MTN-020/ASPIRE demonstrates the feasibility of real-time adherence monitoring while maintaining study blinding at the level of participants, sites, and study leadership. This approach is novel for large-scale effectiveness studies for HIV-1 prevention.

We aimed to comprehensively describe the treatment cascade for RHD in Uganda to identify appropriate targets for intervention. Methods and Results Using data from the Uganda RHD Registry (n=1504), we identified the proportion of patients in the following care categories: (1) diagnosed and alive as of June 1, 2016; (2) retained in care; (3) appropriately prescribed BPG; and (4) optimally adherent to BPG (>80% of prescribed doses). We used logistic regression to investigate factors associated with retention and optimal adherence. Overall, median (interquartile range) age was 23 (15-38) years, 69% were women, and 82% had clinical RHD. Median follow-up time was 2.4 (0.9-4.0) years. Retention in care was the most significant barrier to achieving optimal BPG adherence with only 56.9% (95% confidence interval, 54.1%-59.7%) of living subjects having attended clinic in the prior 56 weeks. Among those retained in care, however, we observed high rates of BPG prescription (91.6%; 95% confidence interval, 89.1%-93.5%) and optimal adherence (91.4%; 95% confidence interval, 88.7-93.5). Younger age, latent disease status, and access to care at a regional center were the strongest independent predictors of retention and optimal adherence. Conclusions Our study suggests that improving retention in carepossibly by decentralizing RHD serviceswould have the greatest impact on uptake of antibiotic prophylaxis among patients with RHD in Uganda.

In this study, the effect of sweet potato variety, postharvest handling conditions, freshly harvested and room/ambient stored roots (3 weeks), and slurry solids content on the viscoelastic properties of complementary porridges prepared using amylase enzyme activation technique were investigated. Five temperatures (55 degrees C, 65 degrees C, 70 degrees C, 75 degrees C, and 80 degrees C) were used to activate sweet potato amylases and the optimum temperature was found to be 75 degrees C. Stored sweet potato roots had higher soluble solids (degrees Brix) content in the pastes compared to fresh roots. In all samples, activation of amylases at 75 degrees C caused changes in the viscoelastic parameters: phase angle (tan delta) and complex viscosity (eta*). Postharvest handling conditions and slurry solids content significantly affected the viscoelastic properties of the porridges with flours from stored roots yielding viscous (liquid-like) porridges and fresh roots producing elastic (solid-like) porridges. Increase in slurry solids content caused reduction in the phase angle values and increase in the viscosity of the sweet potato porridges. The viscosity of the porridges decreased with storage of sweet potato roots. These results provide a possibility for exploiting sweet potato endogenous amylases in the preparation of complementary porridges with both drinkable viscosities and appropriate energy and nutrient densities for children with varying energy needs.

Freshly harvested (noncured) roots and cured roots (spread under the sun for 4 days at 29-31 degrees C and 63-65% relative humidity [RH]) were separately stored at ambient conditions (23 degrees C-26 degrees C and 70-80% RH) and in a semiunderground pit (19-21 degrees C and 90-95% RH). Changes in pasting properties of flour from sweetpotato roots during storage were analyzed at 14-day intervals. Significant varietal differences (p<.05) in total starch, sucrose, glucose, maltose, and fructose concentrations were registered. The total starch and sucrose content of the roots did not change significantly (p<.05) during root development (72.4 and 7.4%, respectively), whereas the average concentrations of glucose, maltose, and fructose decreased markedly (0.46-0.18%, 0.55-0.28%, and 0.43-0.21%), respectively. Storage led to decrease in total starch content (73-47.7%) and increase in sucrose and glucose concentrations (8.1-11.2% and 0.22-1.57%, respectively). Storage also resulted in reduction in sweetpotato flour pasting viscosities. Curing resulted in increased sucrose and glucose concentrations (9.1-11.2% and 0.45-0.85%, respectively) and marked reduction (p<.05) in total starch content (72.9-47.6%). This resulted in low pasting viscosities compared to flour from storage of uncured roots. These findings show that significant changes occur in the carbohydrate components of sweetpotato roots during storage compared to development and present an opportunity for diverse utilization of flours from sweetpotato roots in the food industry.

Physicochemical parameters significantly reduced (p<.05) storage stability of fresh juices, while no significant changes (p>.05) were observed for the microbiological analyses. pH values ranged from 3.0 to 4.2 (dark) bottles and 2.9 to 4.0 (light) bottles for juices at 24 degrees C and 4 degrees C. degrees Brix values were from 1.0 to 5.5 for dark and clear bottles at 24 degrees C and 4 degrees C. TTA (%) values ranged from 1.1 to 7.2 (dark) bottles and 1.1 to 7.4 for (light) bottles at 24 degrees C and 4 degrees C. Ascorbic acid content ranged from 3.5 to 61.0 mg/ 100 ml and 5.5 to 56.7 mg/100 ml for juices in dark and clear bottles, respectively. total plate counts ranged from 1.3 x 10(6) to 3.3 x 10(7) CFU/ml (dark bottles at 24 degrees C) to 3.5 x 10(3) to 3.3 x 10(8) CFU/ml (dark bottles at 4 degrees C). For juices in light bottles, total plate counts ranged from 1.8 x 10(6) to 8.0 x 10(7) CFU/ml (24 degrees C) and 2.7 x 10(4) to 1.5 x 10(8) CFU/ml (4 degrees C). High microbial loads suggest the use of poor processing techniques and lack of good hygiene which lower quality and reduce storage stability of juices. Storage temperature greatly reduces physicochemical parameters both at ambient and refrigeration temperatures. This implies that temperature control for unpasteurized juices is critical in order to inhibit microorganism metabolic activities which accelerate biodeterioration leading to spoilage and short shelf life. Fresh unpasteurized juices stored at 24 degrees C and 4 degrees C may safely be consumed within 1 and 2days, respectively.

The starches' average diameter size ranged between 16.31 and 21.98m. The moisture, protein, and ash content of the starches were: 11.12%-11.84%, 0.1% and 0.23%-0.47% respectively. The amylose content of these starches was between 11% and 13%. The starches peak viscosity ranged between 488.42 and 558.66RVU. The EAHB starches exhibited relatively low pasting temperatures (<75 degrees C), a high peak viscosity (488.42-558.71RVU), high level of viscosity breakdown (235.00-311.92RVU) and low set-back values (61.21-104.33RVU). In general, the EAHB starches' WHCs and SPs increased substantially at 80 degrees C with maximum SP (12.43-14.27g water/g starch) and solubility (12.52%-14.19%) values obtained at 90 degrees C. The starch clarity ranged from 1.7% to 2.3% and followed the same pattern. The starches exhibited poor freeze-thaw stability as they had high syneresis (68% to 72%) after 10 freeze-thaw cycles.

Malnutrition is one of the foremost causes of death among children below 5years in developing countries. Development of nutrient-dense food formulations using locally available crops has been proposed as a means to combat this menace. This study optimized the extrusion process for the production of a nutritious amaranth-based porridge flour. Least cost formulations containing grain amaranth, groundnut, iron-rich beans, pumpkin, orange-fleshed sweet potato, carrot, and maize were developed and evaluated by a sensory panel (n=30) for acceptability using the 9-point hedonic scale. Extrusion process of the most acceptable porridge flour was optimized by response surface methodology (RSM). Barrel temperature (130-170 degrees C) and feed moisture content (14%-20%) were the independent variables which significantly (p<.05) affected in vitro protein digestibility, vitamin A retention, total polyphenol, phytic content, and iron and zinc extractabilities. Optimization of the extrusion process improved the nutritional quality of the instant flour.

Mixed-effects models were fit to determine the association between HIV and BP and amount of effect of HIV on BP mediated through body mass index. Data were analyzed from 577 HIV-infected and 538 matched HIV-uninfected participants. HIV infection was associated with 3.3mmHg lower systolic BP (1.2-5.3mmHg), 1.5mmHg lower diastolic BP (0.2-2.9mmHg), 0.3m/s lower pulse wave velocity (0.1-0.4mmHg), and 30% lower odds of hypertension (10%-50%). Body mass index mediated 25% of the association between HIV and systolic BP. HIV infection was inversely associated with systolic BP, diastolic BP, and pulse wave velocity. Comprehensive community-based programs to routinely screen for cardiovascular risk factors irrespective of HIV status should be operationalized in HIV-endemic countries.

Beyond clinical trials: Cross-sectional associations of combination antiretroviral therapy with reports of multiple symptoms and non-adherence among adolescents in South Africa	SAMJ SOUTH AFRICAN MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							HIV-INFECTED CHILDREN; LONG-TERM SAFETY; ADHERENCE; LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR; ABACAVIR; OUTCOMES; DISCLOSURE; MAGNITUDE; EFAVIRENZ; VARIABLES	Background. Studies investigating symptoms associated with combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) use among adolescents in resource-limited settings are rare beyond clinical trials. Identifying adolescents at risk of non-adherence is imperative for HIV/AIDS programming and controlling the epidemic in this key population. Objective. To examine which cART regimens were associated with reports of multiple symptoms and past-week non-adherence in a large community-traced sample of HIV-positive adolescents in South Africa (SA). Methods. A total of 1 175 HIV-positive ART-experienced adolescents aged 10 - 19 years attending 53 health facilities in the Eastern Cape Province, SA, were interviewed in 2014 - 2015. Ninety percent (n=1 059) were included in the study. Adolescents who reported no medication use and those with unclear or missing data were excluded from further analysis, resulting in a sample for analysis of n=501. Outcomes were reports of multiple symptoms (three or more symptoms in the past 6 months) and past-week ART non-adherence (<95% correct doses in the past week). Multivariable logistic regression analyses controlled for sociodemographic and HIV-related covariates in Stata 13/IC. Results. Of the adolescents included, 54.3% were female. The median age was 14 (interquartile range 12 - 16) years, and 66.5% were vertically infected. The prevalence of multiple symptoms was 59.7% (95% confidence interval (CI) 55.3 - 63.9). Independent of covariates, stavudine (d4T)-containing cART regimens and the fixed-dose combination of tenofovir (TDF) + emtricitabine (FTC) + efavirenz (EFV) were associated with more reports of multiple symptoms (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.38; 95% CI 1.19 - 9.60 and aOR 2.67; 95% CI 1.21 - 5.88, respectively). Lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r)-containing regimens were associated with fewer reports of multiple symptoms (aOR 0.47; 95% CI 0.21 - 1.04). For EFV-based regimens, adolescents on d4T + lamivudine (3TC) + EFV were more likely to report multiple symptoms than those on TDF + FTC + EFV or those on abacavir (ABC) + 3TC + EFV (aOR 3.26; 95% CI 1.01 - 10.52, aOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.35 - 6.05 and aOR 1.08; 95% CI 0.64 - 1.82, respectively). However, only TDF + FTC + EFV cART was associated with lower levels of non-adherence among participants (aOR 0.44; 95% CI 0.21 - 0.93). Conclusions. Rates of multiple symptoms among HIV-positive ART-experienced adolescents were high. d4T-containing regimens and TDF + FTC + EFV were associated with more reports of multiple symptoms, whereas LPV/r-containing regimens were associated with fewer reports. However, adolescents on TDF + FTC + EFV were the most adherent subgroup. These findings support the World Health Organization-recommended discontinuation of d4T use, but also underscore the dilemma faced by clinicians when choosing between low-toxicity regimens and those that promote ART adherence, particularly among HIV-positive adolescents.

In Uganda, contraceptive implants are not routinely available during the immediate postpartum period. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the proportion of women using levonorgestrel contraceptive implants at 6 months after delivery in women randomized to immediate or delayed insertion. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled trial among women in Kampala, Uganda. Women who desired contraceptive implants were randomly assigned to insertion of a 2-rod contraceptive implant system containing 75 mg of levonorgestrel immediately following delivery (within 5 days of delivery and before discharge from the hospital) or delayed insertion (6 weeks postpartum). The primary outcome was implant utilization at 6 months postpartum. RESULTS: From June to October 2015, 205 women were randomized, 103 to the immediate group and 102 to the delayed group. Ninety-three percent completed the 6 month follow-up visit. At 6 months, implant use was higher in the immediate group compared with the delayed group (97% vs 68%; P < .001), as was the use of any highly effective contraceptive (98% vs 81%; P = .001). Women in the immediate group were more satisfied with the timing of implant placement. If given the choice, 81% of women in the immediate group and 63% of women in the delayed group would choose the same timing of placement again (P = .01). There were no serious adverse events in either group. CONCLUSION: Offering women the option of initiating contraceptive implants in the immediate postpartum period has the potential to increase contraceptive utilization, decrease unwanted pregnancies, prevent short interpregnancy intervals, and help women achieve their reproductive goals.

Marked variation in prevalence of malaria-protective human genetic polymorphisms across Uganda	INFECTION GENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Malaria; Plasmodium; Sickle; Thalassemia; G6PD; CD36	PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; RED-CELL; POPULATION-GENETICS; RESISTANCE GENES; G6PD DEFICIENCY; WEST-AFRICA; IN-VIVO; SUSCEPTIBILITY; CD36; HEMOGLOBIN	A number of human genetic polymorphisms are prevalent in tropical populations and appear to offer protection against symptomatic and/or severe malaria. We compared the prevalence of four polymorphisms, the sickle hemoglobin mutation (beta globin E6V), the a-thalassemia 3.7 kb deletion, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency caused by the common African variant (G6PD A-), and the CD36 T188G mutation in 1344 individuals residing in districts in eastern (Tororo), south-central (Jinja), and southwestern (Kanungu) Uganda. Genes of interest were amplified, amplicons subjected to mutation-specific restriction endonuclease digestion (for sickle hemoglobin, G6PD A-, and CD36 T188G), reaction products resolved by electrophoresis, and genotypes determined based on the sizes of reaction products. Mutant genotypes were common, with many more heterozygous than homozygous alleles identified. The prevalences (heterozygotes plus homozygotes) of sickle hemoglobin (28% Tororo, 25% Jinja, 7% Kanungu), alpha-thalassemia (53% Tororo, 45% Jinja, 18% Kanungu) and G6PD A-(29% Tororo, 18% Jinja, 8% Kanungu) were significantly greater in Tororo and Jinja compared to Kanungu (p < 0.0001 for all three alleles); prevalences were also significantly greater in Tororo compared to Jinja for a-thalassemia (p = 0.03) and G6PD A-(p < 0.0001). For the CD36 T188G mutation, the prevalence was significantly greater in Tororo compared to Jinja or Kanungu (27% Tororo, 17% Jinja, 18% Kanungu; p = 0.0004 and 0.0017, respectively). Considering ethnicity of study subjects, based on primary language spoken, the prevalence of mutant genotypes was lower in Bantu compared to non-Bantu language speakers, but in the Jinja cohort, the only study population with a marked diversity of language groups, prevalence did not differ between Bantu and non-Bantu speakers. These results indicate marked differences in human genetic features between populations in different regions of Uganda. These differences might be explained by both ethnic variation and by varied malaria risk in different regions of Uganda.

Studies of brucellosis in Uganda have emphasized occupational exposures and also revealed variations in prevalence levels by region and cattle production systems. To date, research linking pastoralist household income from dairy production to brucellosis and its transmission risk pathways do not exist in Uganda. We assessed whether spatial differences in unit milk prices can be explained by brucellosis prevalence in cattle along a distance gradient from Lake Mburo National Park in Uganda. Semi-structured interviews administered to 366 randomly selected household heads were supplemented with serological data on brucellosis in cattle. Statistical analysis included Pearson correlation test, multiple regression and analysis of variance (ANOVA) using SPSS version 17. Serological results showed that 44% of cattle blood samples were sero-positive for brucellosis. The results obtained from interviews put the statistical mean of household reported cattle abortions at 5.39 (5.08-5.70 at 95% CI, n=366). Post -hoc analysis of variance revealed that both sero-positive cattle and reported cattle abortions significantly were much lower when moving outwards from the park boundary (p <0.05), while the price of milk increased significantly (p <0.05) along the same distance gradient. Further studies should identify public and private partnerships needed to create and strengthen good zoonotic brucellosis management practices at the nexus of wildlife and livestock in Uganda.

TEC derived from some GPS stations in East African equatorial region and comparison with the TEC from NeQuick2 model	ADVANCES IN SPACE RESEARCH			English	Article						Ionosphere; GPS; Total electron content; NeQuick2	ELECTRON-DENSITY; IRI; BEACON; RADAR	This paper investigates the capacity of NeQuick2 model in predicting the vertical Total Electron Content (vTEC) over East Africa equatorial region during solar minimum (2010) and solar maximum (2012) phases. This has been carried out by comparing the NeQuick2 vTEC and GPS vTEC from five GPS (Global Positioning System) receivers at Makerere University, University of Nairobi, Mbarara, Malindi and Addis Ababa. The diurnal, monthly and seasonal variations in the measured vTEC have been analysed and compared with the NeQuick2 modeled vTEC. Comparative analysis has shown high correlation between NeQuick2 vTEC and GPS vTEC for both years. The correlation coefficients (R-2) between the predicted and measured vTEC at all the stations were in the range (0.884-0.953) and (0.881-0.910) in 2010 and 2012 years respectively. NeQuick2 predicted the diurnal vTEC better for the times 01:00-03:00, Universal Time (UT) (10:00-12:00, Local Time, LT) for all the stations than for other times. There were high discrepancies between the modeled and measured vTEC values as observed between 06:00-16:00 UT (09:00-19:00 LT) over Addis Ababa during the two years in consideration. With regard to the monthly and seasonal vTEC prediction, the NeQuick2 model overestimates both the monthly and seasonal mean hourly vTEC values in almost all the stations except at Addis Ababa. The effects of geomagnetic storm on NeQuick2 model has also been investigated. NeQuick2 model did not respond to the effects associated with geomagnetic storm. There is need to include storm related parameters in the prediction of vTEC using NeQuick2 model. (C) 2017 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Despite the important epidemiological role that weed-infecting begomoviruses play, they remain insufficiently studied in Africa. Recently, we identified Deinbollia mosaic virus (DMV), a distinct begomovirus found naturally infecting the weed host Deinbollia borbonica (Sapindaceae) in Kenya and Tanzania. In this study, we investigated the capacity of DMV to infect a restricted host range of Solanaceae and Euphorbiaceae species. Biolistic inoculation of Nicotiana benthamiana with concatemeric DNAs resulted in systemic infection associated with yellow mosaic symptoms, while DNA partial dimers caused asymptomatic systemic infection. DMV was not infectious to cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz), suggesting host resistance to the virus. Here, we demonstrate the first experimental infectivity analysis of DMV in N. benthamiana and cassava.

Process data were obtained using mixed methods. Variables evaluated were indicators of feasibility and acceptability; causal mediating processes and contextual influences. GSP was feasible and acceptable. Potential mediating variables between GSP and reduction of depression were improved emotional and social support, better coping strategies, and pursuit of livelihoods. Culturally sensitive intervention content facilitated intervention delivery. These data complement the trial outcomes, and may provide a contextualized description of how GSP treats depression.

"...if you bring the kit home, you [can] get time and test together with your partner': Pregnant women and male partners' perceptions regarding female partner-delivered HIV self-testing in Uganda - A qualitative study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF STD & AIDS			English	Article						Female partner-delivered HIV self-test; male partner; couple HIV testing; Uganda	ACCEPTABILITY; CARE; MEN; SEX	In 2015, the World Health Organization reported that more than 60 million people were tested for HIV in 122 low- and middle-income countries between 2010 and 2014. Despite this level of progress, over 40% of people living with HIV remain unaware of their HIV status. This calls for innovative approaches to improve uptake of HIV testing services, including use of HIV self-test (HIVST) kits. We conducted a cross-sectional, qualitative study to assess pregnant women and their male partners' perceptions regarding female partner-delivered HIVST kits. This study was conducted at two health facilities in Central Uganda between November and December 2015. Data were collected on pregnant women's willingness to take HIVST kits to their male partners and other household members using eight focus group discussions and 30 in-depth interviews. Data were analyzed following a thematic framework approach. Overall, pregnant women were willing to take HIVST kits to their partners and other household members, with the exception of their cowives. Male partners were willing to use HIVST kits brought by their female partners. Our findings suggest that secondary distribution of HIVST kits through female partners is acceptable and has the potential to improve male partner and household-member HIV testing.	[Matovu, Joseph K.

Visceral leishmaniasis relapse hazard is linked to reduced miltefosine exposure in patients from Eastern Africa: a population pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study	JOURNAL OF ANTIMICROBIAL CHEMOTHERAPY			English	Article							CHILDREN; PHARMACOKINETICS; QUANTIFICATION; FAILURE	Background: Low efficacy of miltefosine in the treatment of visceral leishmaniasis was recently observed in Eastern Africa. Objectives: To describe the pharmacokinetics and establish a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic relationship for miltefosine in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, using a time-to-event approach to model relapse of disease. Methods: Miltefosine plasma concentrations from 95 patients (48 monotherapy versus 47 combination therapy) were included in the population pharmacokinetic model using non-linear mixed effects modelling. Subsequently a time-to-event model was developed to model the time of clinical relapse. Various summary pharmacokinetic parameters (various AUCs, Time > EC50, Time > EC90), normalized within each treatment arm to allow simultaneous analysis, were evaluated as relapse hazard-changing covariates. Results: A two-compartment population model with first-order absorption fitted the miltefosine pharmacokinetic data adequately. Relative bioavailability was reduced (- 74%, relative standard error 4.7%) during the first week of treatment of the monotherapy arm but only the first day of the shorter combination regimen. Time to the relapse of infection could be described using a constant baseline hazard (baseline 1.8 relapses/year, relative standard error 72.7%). Miltefosine Time > EC90 improved the model significantly when added in a maximum effect function on the baseline hazard (half maximal effect with Time. > EC90 6.97 days for monotherapy). Conclusions: Miltefosine drug exposure was found to be decreased in Eastern African patients with visceral leishmaniasis, due to a (transient) initial lower bioavailability. Relapse hazard was inversely linked to miltefosine exposure. Significantly lower miltefosine exposure was observed in children compared with adults, further urging the need for implementation of dose adaptations for children.	[Dorlo, Thomas P.

Despite the successes of numerous school-based interventions for promoting child mental health, most evidence-based interventions (EBIs) are not available in SSA. This study investigated the implementation quality and effectiveness of one component of an EBI from a developed country (USA) in a SSA country (Uganda). The EBI component, Professional Development, was provided by trained Ugandan mental health professionals to Ugandan primary school teachers. It included large-group experiential training and small-group coaching to introduce and support a range of evidence-based practices (EBPs) to create nurturing and predictable classroom experiences. The study was guided by the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, the Teacher Training Implementation Model, and the RE-AIM evaluation framework. Effectiveness outcomes were studied using a cluster randomized design, in which 10 schools were randomized to intervention and wait-list control conditions. A total of 79 early childhood teachers participated. Teacher knowledge and the use of EBPs were assessed at baseline and immediately post-intervention (4-5 months later). A sample of 154 parents was randomly selected to report on child behavior at baseline and post-intervention. Linear mixed effect modeling was applied to examine effectiveness outcomes. Findings support the feasibility of training Ugandan mental health professionals to provide Professional Development for Ugandan teachers. Professional Development was delivered with high levels of fidelity and resulted in improved teacher EBP knowledge and the use of EBPs in the classroom, and child social competence.

Partners Prevention; Partners PrEP Study Team	A cross-sectional analysis of Trichomonas vaginalis infection among heterosexual HIV-1 serodiscordant African couples	SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS			English	Article							BACTERIAL VAGINOSIS; MALE CIRCUMCISION; MALE PARTNERS; RISK-FACTORS; WOMEN; MEN; ACQUISITION; TANZANIA; DISEASE	Objectives Trichomonas vaginalis is the most prevalent curable STI worldwide and has been associated with adverse health outcomes and increased HIV-1 transmission risk. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis among couples to assess how characteristics of both individuals in sexual partnerships are associated with the prevalence of male and female T. vaginalis infection. Methods African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples were concurrently tested for trichomoniasis at enrolment into two clinical trials. T. vaginalis testing was by nucleic acid amplification or culture methods. Using Poisson regression with robust standard errors, we identified characteristics associated with trichomoniasis. Results Among 7531 couples tested for trichomoniasis, 981 (13%) couples contained at least one infected partner. The prevalence was 11% (n=857) among women and 4% (n=319) among men, and most infected individuals did not experience signs or symptoms of T. vaginalis. Exploring concordance of T. vaginalis status within sexual partnerships, we observed that 61% (195/319) of T. vaginalis-positive men and 23% (195/857) of T. vaginalis-positive women had a concurrently infected partner. In multivariable analysis, having a T. vaginalis-positive partner was the strongest predictor of infection for women (relative risk (RR) 4.70, 95% CI 4.10 to 5.38) and men (RR 10.09, 95% CI 7.92 to 12.85). For women, having outside sex partners, gonorrhoea, and intermediate or high Nugent scores for bacterial vaginosis were associated with increased risk of trichomoniasis, whereas age 45 years and above, being married, having children and injectable contraceptive use were associated with reduced trichomoniasis risk. Additionally, women whose male partners were circumcised, had more education or earned income had lower risk of trichomoniasis. Conclusions We found that within African HIV-1 serodiscordant heterosexual couples, the prevalence of trichomoniasis was high among partners of T. vaginalis-infected individuals, suggesting that partner services could play an important role identifying additional cases and preventing reinfection. Our results also suggest that male circumcision may reduce the risk of male-to-female T. vaginalis transmission.

Authorship in paediatric research conducted in low- and middle-income countries: parity or parasitism?	TROPICAL MEDICINE & INTERNATIONAL HEALTH			English	Article						global health; authorship; research; paediatric; sante mondiale; paternite d'auteur; recherche; pediatrie	RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS; JOURNALS	ObjectivesInterest in global health has increased greatly in the past two decades. Concomitantly, the number and complexity of research partnerships between high-income (HIC) and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has grown. We aimed to determine whether there is authorship parity (equitable representation and author order) or parasitism (no authors from study countries) in paediatric research conducted in LMICs. MethodsWe reviewed all articles published from 2006 to 2015 in the four paediatric journals with the highest Eigenfactor scores. We limited our review to articles from LMICs and abstracted information on author affiliation and order, funding source and study design. We calculated Student's t-tests and chi-square using Fisher's exact test with Monte Carlo estimates. ResultsThere were 24 169 articles published during the study period, and 1243 met inclusion criteria. Of those, 95.9% (n=1,192) included at least one author affiliated with a LMIC. Among multicountry studies (n=165), 40.4% did not include authors from every LMIC involved. Of the 9876 authors, most were affiliated with institutions from upper-middle-income countries (41.7%) and HICs (32.7%), with far fewer affiliated with lower middle-income (15.5%) and low-income countries (5.4%) (P<0.001). In articles from low-income countries, first and last authors from HICs were more common than authors with low-income country affiliations (P<0.001). ConclusionsAuthorship parasitism was rare overall but common in multicountry studies. In studies conducted in low-income countries, HIC authors more commonly occupied first and last author positions than authors from the study countries. Where LMIC authors make substantial contributions, researchers should strive for authorship parity. ObjectifsL'interet pour la sante mondiale a considerablement augmente au cours des deux dernieres decennies. Parallelement, le nombre et la complexite des partenariats de recherche entre les pays a revenu eleve (PRE) et les pays a revenu faible et intermediaire (PRF-PRI) ont augmente. Nous avons cherche a determiner s'il existait une parite dans la paternite d'auteur (representation equitable et ordre des auteurs) ou du parasitisme (aucun auteur des pays d'etude) dans la recherche pediatrique menee dans les PRF-PRI. MethodesNous avons analyse tous les articles publies de 2006 a 2015 dans les quatre revues pediatriques avec les scores Eigenfactor les plus eleves. Nous avons limite notre analyse aux articles sur les PRF-PRI et avons extrait les informations sur l'affiliation et l'ordre des auteurs, la source de financement et la conception de l'etude. Nous avons calcule les valeurs t-tests de Student et Chi-Carre a l'aide du test exact de Fisher avec les estimations de Monte Carlo. ResultatsIl y avait 24.169 articles publies au cours de la periode d'etude et 1.243 repondaient aux criteres d'inclusion. De ceux-ci, 95,9% (n = 1,192) comprenaient au moins un auteur affilie a un PRF-PRI. Parmi les etudes multi-pays (n = 165), 40,4% n'ont pas inclus d'auteurs de chaque PRF-PRI implique. Sur les 9.876 auteurs, la plupart etaient affilies a des institutions de pays a revenu moyennement eleve (41,7%) et a des PRE (32,7%) avec beaucoup moins d'auteurs affilies a des pays faiblement eleves (15,5%) et a des PRF (5,4%) (p <0,001). Dans les articles provenant de PRF, les premier et derniers auteurs de PRE etaient plus frequents que les auteurs ayant des affiliations avec des PRF (p <0,001). ConclusionsLe parasitisme dans la paternite d'auteur etait rare globalement mais courant dans les etudes multi-pays. Dans les etudes realisees dans les PRF, les auteurs de PRE occupent plus frequemment les premiers et derniers auteurs que les auteurs des pays d'etude. La oU les auteurs de PRF-PRI apportent une contribution substantielle, les chercheurs devraient viser la parite dans la paternite d'auteur.

We assessed whether ART initiation, and viral suppression 6, 12, and 24 months after ART initiation, were lower in HIV-infected members of serodiscordant couples who initiated during pregnancy or with higher CD4 counts. We used data from the Partners Demonstration Project, an open-label study of the delivery of integrated pre-exposure prophylaxis and ART (at any CD4 count) for HIV prevention among high-risk HIV serodiscordant couples in Kenya and Uganda. Differences in viral suppression (HIV RNA <400 copies/ml) among people initiating ART at different CD4 count levels (350, 351-500, and >500 cells/mm(3)) and during pregnancy were estimated using Poisson regression. Of 865 HIV-infected participants retained after becoming eligible for ART during study follow-up, 95% initiated ART. Viral suppression 24 months after ART initiation was high overall (97%), and comparable among those initiating ART at CD4 counts >500, 351-500, and 350 cells/mm(3) [96% vs. 97% vs. 97%; relative risk (RR) 0.98; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.93-1.03 for CD4>500 vs. <350 and RR 0.99; 95% CI: (0.93-1.06) for CD4 351-500 vs. 350]. Viral suppression was as likely among women initiating ART primarily to prevent perinatal transmission as ART initiation for other reasons (p=.9 at 6 months and p=.5 at 12 months). Nearly all HIV-infected partners initiating ART were virally suppressed by 24 months, irrespective of CD4 count or pregnancy status. These findings suggest that people initiating ART at high CD4 counts or due to pregnancy can adhere to ART as well as those starting treatment with symptomatic HIV disease or low CD4 counts.

We report the first 3,985 PANGEA-HIV consensus sequences from four cohort sites (Rakai Community Cohort Study, n=2,833; MRC/UVRI Uganda, n=701; Mochudi Prevention Project, n=359; Africa Health Research Institute Resistance Cohort, n=92). Next-generation sequencing success rates varied: more than 80% of the viral genome from the gag to the nef genes could be determined for all sequences from South Africa, 75% of sequences from Mochudi, 60% of sequences from MRC/UVRI Uganda, and 22% of sequences from Rakai. Partial sequencing failure was primarily associated with low viral load, increased for amplicons closer to the 3 end of the genome, was not associated with subtype diversity except HIV-1 subtype D, and remained significantly associated with sampling location after controlling for other factors. We assessed the impact of the missing data patterns in PANGEA-HIV sequences on phylogeny reconstruction in simulations. We found a threshold in terms of taxon sampling below which the patchy distribution of missing characters in next-generation sequences (NGS) has an excess negative impact on the accuracy of HIV-1 phylogeny reconstruction, which is attributable to tree reconstruction artifacts that accumulate when branches in viral trees are long. The large number of PANGEA-HIV sequences provides unprecedented opportunities for evaluating HIV-1 transmission dynamics across sub-Saharan Africa and identifying prevention opportunities. Molecular epidemiological analyses of these data must proceed cautiously because sequence sampling remains below the identified threshold and a considerable negative impact of missing characters on phylogeny reconstruction is expected.

Knowledge of HBV status is important to guide optimal selection of antiretroviral therapy (ART) and monitor/prevent liver-related complications. We describe changes in testing practices and management of HBV infection over a 3-year period in HIV clinics across SSA. Methods: A medical chart review was conducted in large urban HIV treatment centers in Cote d'Ivoire (3 sites), Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Uganda and Zambia (1 site each). Of the patients who started ART between 2010 and 2012, 100 per year were randomly selected from each clinic. Demographic, clinical and laboratory information as well as individual treatment histories were collected using a standardized questionnaire. We examined changes over time in the proportion of patients screened for HBV infection (HBV surface antigen [HBsAg]-positivity), identified predictors of HBV testing using logistic regression, and assessed the proportion of patients initiating a tenofovir (TDF)-containing ART regimen. Results: Overall, 3579 charts of patients initiating ART (64.4% female, median age 37 years) were reviewed in 12 clinics. The proportion of patients screened for HBsAg increased from 17.8% in 2010 to 24.4% in 2012 overall, and ranged from 0.7% in Kenya to 96% in South Africa. In multivariable analyses, age and region were associated with HBsAg screening. Among 759 individuals tested, 88 (11.6%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 9.4-14.1) were HBV-infected, of whom 71 (80.7%) received a TDF-containing ART regimen. HBsAg-positive individuals were twice as likely to receive a TDF-containing first-line ART regimen compared to HBsAg-negative patients (80.7% vs. 40.3%, p < 0.001). The proportion of patients on TDF-containing ART increased from 57.9% in 2010 to 90.2% in 2012 in HIV/HBV-co-infected patients (Chi-2 test for trend: p = 0.01). Only 114 (5.0%) patients were screened for anti-HCV antibodies and one of them (0.9%, 95% CI 0.02-4.79) had a confirmed HCV infection. Conclusions: The systematic screening for HBV infection in HIV-positive patients before ART initiation was limited in most African countries and its uptake varied widely across clinics. Overall, the prescription of TDF increased over time, with 90% of HIV/HBV-coinfected patients receiving this drug in 2012.

Association of genetic variation with blood pressure traits among East Africans	CLINICAL GENETICS			English	Article						diastolic blood pressure; East Africa; genetics; SNPs; systolic blood pressure	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; RISK-FACTORS; HYPERTENSION; POPULATION; METAANALYSIS; HISTORY; LOCI; REPLICATION; DIVERSITY; VARIANTS	IntroductionGenetic variation may play explain some of the disparity in prevalence and control of hypertension across Sub-Saharan Africa. However, there have been very few studies to characterize genetic variation of blood pressure traits. AimTo determine whether a set of blood pressure-associated genetic loci can be replicated among samples East African samples. MethodsTwenty-seven blood pressures (BP)-related single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped among 2881 samples from participants in the Medical Education Partnership Initiative for Cardiovascular Disease (MEPI-CVD) survey. Associations with known BP variants were evaluated for systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and pulse pressure (PP) as continuous variables and for hypertension (HTN) as a binary variable. ResultsEleven SNPS were associated with at least 1 BP trait (P < .05). Four SNPs; rs2004776, rs7726475, rs11837544 and rs2681492, whose nearest genes are AGT, NPR3/SUB1, PLXNC1 and ATP2B1, respectively, were associated with SBP. Six SNPs, rs2004776, rs11977526, rs11191548, rs381815, rs2681492 and rs1327235, close to AGT, IGFBP3, CYP17A1, PLEKHA7, ATP2B1 and JAG, respectively, were associated with DBP while 2 SNPs located within AGT and IGFBP-3 genes associated with HTN. For PP, 4 variants rs1458038, rs11725861, rs7726475 and rs11953630 whose corresponding genes are FGF5, CHIC2, SUB1/NPR3 and EBF1 reached significance (P < .05). Eight SNPs were replicated in the same effect direction as the parent studies. Risk scores defined using published effect sizes were significantly associated with both SBP (P = .0026) and DBP (P = .0214). ConclusionThe replication of multiple BP variants among East Africans suggests that these variants may have universal effects across ethnic populations.

J	Dovie, DBK; Lwasa, S				Dovie, Delali Benjamin K.; Lwasa, Shuaib			Correlating negotiation hotspot issues, Paris climate agreement and the international climate policy regime	ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & POLICY			English	Article						Adaptation; Ambitious targets; COP; Ghana; Mitigation; Multilateralism	BREAKTHROUGH; SCIENCE	The concerns over climate change negotiation, decision texts and links to domestic policy interests of countries to keep warming within an acceptable limit have become the 'hotspot issues' of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). Hotspot issues are the human - political economy factors which have evolved over time from negotiation texts or phrases, principles or behaviors with tendencies to influence climate negotiations yet cannot be identified with the scientific literature. Whilst big emitters have been accused as having hegemony over the negotiations, the effects of disunity amongst the parties over domestic policy interests have been overlooked. Hence the article examines the emergence of hotspot issues and how they manifest within the international climate policy regime. The Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs) of 130 countries submitted before the Paris agreement, were analyzed using the following texts: Adaptation, Mitigation, Co-benefits, Finance, Land use, Food security, Poverty, Resilience, Green growth, Green economy, Sustainable development, Biodiversity, Ecosystem services and Conservation. Of these, 'adaptation' was cited 2780 times, 1956 for 'mitigation' and 32 for 'ecosystem services' in the nature conservation category. Ten phases of the climate policy regime and historical hotspot issues were identified for the period 1980-2030. 'Adaptation' and mitigation appeared more frequently in the INDCs and correlated with each other (r = 0.56), as the two correlated further with 'land use' (0.50 < r < 0.60), and similarly with sustainable development (0.40 < r < 0.70) where 'r' is the Pearson Rank Correlation. Therefore the success of the 'ambitious targets' for mitigation will depend on similar ambitious goals for adaptation, land use and sustainable development. Several differences existed in the correlation of the hotspot issues within the regional geographical blocs (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania, South America) and split along the hotspot issues yet Europe mostly oriented towards mitigation and land use, and Oceania on resilience building. These differences provide favorable conditions for increased cooperation and true multilateralism if they are properly diagnosed.

This paper analyses how 12 deprived women in Kampala, Uganda, perceived corporal punishment, drawing on repeated semi-structured interviews. All thought it was sometimes necessary, for three main reasons. First, it was an important strategy to ensure good behaviour and maintain their and their child's, respectability, crucial to self-respect given severe poverty. Second, it was a means of establishing household routines and managing scarce resources. Third, it was a way to protect children from health risks. However, all mothers thought corporal punishment could be excessive, and most said it can be counter-productive, making children 'stubborn'. There appeared to be considerable variation in their degree of harsh parenting and emotional support. These findings could inform culturally appropriate interventions to reduce violence against children.

However, most parenting programmes find it difficult to recruit fathers. We piloted a 21 session parenting intervention, 'Parenting for Respectability', with fathers and mothers near Kampala, Uganda. Sixty-one fathers and 83 mothers were recruited initially and 52 fathers and 76 mothers retained to the end. We interviewed with 24 fathers and 16 mothers. Data were analysed thematically. Success in involving fathers was probably due to (a) the first 10 sessions being father-only, allowing them to share experiences before participating in mixed-sex sessions; (b) exploiting men's pre-existing motivation to improve their children's behaviour, thereby enhancing family respectability; and (c) the interactive, participatory delivery. Mixed sessions enabled couples to clarify conflicting perspectives regarding spousal relationships and gendered norms. However, men experienced social pressure to conform to conventional masculinity, suggesting the need to instil intervention values at community level.

Changes to interface habitats can increase environmental overlap among nonhuman primates, people, and domestic animals and change stress levels in wildlife, leading to changes in their risk of parasite infections. However, the direction and consequences of these changes are unclear, since animals may benefit by exploiting human resources (e.g., improving nutritional health by eating nutritious crops) and decreasing susceptibility to infection, or interactions with humans may lead to chronic stress and increased susceptibility to infection. Vervet monkeys are an excellent model to understand parasitic disease transmission because of their tolerance to anthropogenic disturbance. Here we quantify the gastrointestinal parasites of a group of vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) near Lake Nabugabo, Uganda, that frequently overlaps with people in their use of a highly modified environment. We compare the parasites found in this population to seven other sites where vervet monkey gastrointestinal parasites have been identified. The vervets of Lake Nabugabo have the greatest richness of parasites documented to date. We discuss how this may reflect differences in sampling intensity or differences in the types of habitat where vervet parasites have been sampled.

This is a state-of-the-art review article in which we outline what is known about the current scope of trainee and clinician involvement in GH experiences, highlight specific considerations and issues pertinent to GH engagement, and summarize preparation recommendations that have emerged from the literature. The article is focused primarily on short-term GH experiences, although much of the content is also pertinent to long-term work. Suggestions are made for the health care community to develop and implement widely endorsed preparation standards for trainees, clinicians, and organizations engaging in GH experiences and partnerships.

We investigated long-term VL and resistance in HIV-infected children managed without real-time VL monitoring. Methods and findings In the ARROW factorial trial, 1,206 children initiating ART in Uganda and Zimbabwe between 15 March 2007 and 18 November 2008, aged a median 6 years old, with median CD4% of 12%, were randomised to monitoring with or without 12-weekly CD4 counts and to receive 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (2NRTI, mainly abacavir+lamivudine) with a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or 3 NRTIs as long-term ART. All children had VL assayed retrospectively after a median of 4 years on ART; those with >1,000 copies/ml were genotyped. Three hundred and sixteen children had VL and genotypes assayed longitudinally (at least every 24 weeks). Overall, 67 (6%) switched to second-line ART and 54 (4%) died. In children randomised to WHO-recommended 2NRTI+NNRTI long-term ART, 308/378 (81%) monitored with CD4 counts versus 297/375 (79%) without had VL <1,000 copies/ml at 4 years (difference = +2.3% [95% CI -3.4% to +8.0%]; P = 0.43), with no evidence of differences in intermediate/high-level resistance to 11 drugs. Among children with longitudinal VLs, only 5% of child-time post-week 24 was spent with persistent low-level viraemia (80-5,000 copies/ml) and 10% with VL rebound >= 5,000 copies/ml. No child resuppressed <80 copies/ml after confirmed VL rebound >= 5,000 copies/ml. A median of 1.0 (IQR 0.0,1.5) additional NRTI mutation accumulated over 2 years' rebound. Nineteen out of 48 (40%) VLs 1,000-5,000 copies/ml were immediately followed by resuppression <1,000 copies/ml, but only 17/155 (11%) VLs >= 5,000 copies/ml resuppressed (P < 0.0001). Main study limitations are that analyses were exploratory and treatment initiation used 2006 criteria, without pre-ART genotypes. Conclusions In this study, children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa without real-time VL monitoring had good virological and resistance outcomes over 4 years, regardless of CD4 monitoring strategy. Many children with detectable low-level viraemia spontaneously resuppressed, highlighting the importance of confirming virological failure before switching to second-line therapy. Children experiencing rebound >= 5,000 copies/ml were much less likely to resuppress, but NRTI resistance increased only slowly. These results are relevant to the increasing numbers of HIV-infected children receiving first-line ART in sub-Saharan Africa with limited access to virological monitoring.

A prospective neurosurgical registry evaluating the clinical care of traumatic brain injury patients presenting to Mulago National Referral Hospital in Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							LOW-INCOME; BURDEN; IMPACT; OUTCOMES	Background Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is disproportionally concentrated in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), with the odds of dying from TBI in Uganda more than 4 times higher than in high income countries (HICs). The objectives of this study are to describe the processes of care and determine risk factors predictive of poor outcomes for TBI patients presenting to Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH), Kampala, Uganda. Methods We used a prospective neurosurgical registry based on Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) to systematically collect variables spanning 8 categories. Univariate and multivariate analysis were conducted to determine significant predictors of mortality. Results 563 TBI patients were enrolled from 1 June-30 November 2016. 102 patients (18%) received surgery, 29 patients (5.1%) intended for surgery failed to receive it, and 251 patients (45%) received non-operative management. Overall mortality was 9.6%, which ranged from 4.7% for mild and moderate TBI to 55% for severe TBI patients with GCS 3-5. Within each TBI severity category, mortality differed by management pathway. Variables predictive of mortality were TBI severity, more than one intracranial bleed, failure to receive surgery, high dependency unit admission, ventilator support outside of surgery, and hospital arrival delayed by more than 4 hours. Conclusions The overall mortality rate of 9.6% in Uganda for TBI is high, and likely underestimates the true TBI mortality. Furthermore, the wide-ranging mortality (3-82%), high ICU fatality, and negative impact of care delays suggest shortcomings with the current triaging practices. Lack of surgical intervention when needed was highly predictive of mortality in TBI patients. Further research into the determinants of surgical interventions, quality of step-up care, and prolonged care delays are needed to better understand the complex interplay of variables that affect patient outcome. These insights guide the development of future interventions and resource allocation to improve patient outcomes.

IMPAACT P1079 Protocol Team	Concomitant nevirapine impacts pharmacokinetic exposure to the antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine in African children	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; INFECTED UGANDAN ADULTS; HUMAN PLASMA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; ARTEMISININ RESISTANCE; METABOLITE DIHYDROARTEMISININ; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; DRUG-INTERACTION; ARTEMETHER/LUMEFANTRINE; EFAVIRENZ	Background The antiretroviral drug nevirapine and the antimalarial artemisinin-based combination therapy artemether-lumefantrine are commonly co-administered to treat malaria in the context of HIV. Nevirapine is a known inhibitor of cytochrome P450 3A4, which metabolizes artemether and lumefantrine. To address the concern that the antiretroviral nevirapine impacts the antimalarial artemether-lumefantrine pharmacokinetics, a prospective non-randomized controlled study in children presenting with uncomplicated malaria and HIV in sub-Saharan Africa was carried out. Methods Participants received artemether-lumefantrine (20/120 mg weight-based BID) for 3 days during nevirapine-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) co-administration (158-266 mg/m(2) QD). HIV positive participants who were not yet on ART drugs were also enrolled as the control group. The target enrollment was children aged 3-12 years (n = 24 in each group). Intensive pharmacokinetics after the last artemether-lumefantrine dose was assessed for artemether, its active metabolite dihydroartemisinin, and lumefantrine. Pharmacokinetic parameters (area under the plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), maximum concentration and day 7 lumefantrine concentrations) were estimated using non-compartmental methods and compared to controls. Results Nineteen children (16 on nevirapine and three not on ART) enrolled. Fifteen of the 16 (aged 4 to 11 years) on nevirapine-based ART were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis. Due to evolving WHO HIV treatment guidelines, insufficient children were enrolled in the control group (n = 3), so the pharmacokinetic data were compared to a historical control group of 20 HIV-uninfected children 5-12 years of age who also presented with malaria and underwent identical study procedures. Decreases of pharmacokinetic exposure [ as estimated by AUC (AUC(0-8hr))] were marginally significant for artemether (by -46%, p = 0.08) and dihydroartemisinin (-22%, p = 0.06) in the children on nevirapine-based ART, compared to when arte-mether- lumefantrine was administered alone. Similarly, peak concentration was decreased by 50% (p = 0.07) for artemether and 36% (p = 0.01) for dihydroartemisinin. In contrast, exposure to lumefantrine increased significantly in the context of nevirapine [AUC(0120hr): 123% (p< 0.001); C-day7: 116% (p< 0.001), C-max: 95% (p< 0.001)]. Conclusions Nevirapine-based ART increases the exposure to lumefantrine in pre-pubescent children with a trend toward diminished artemether and dihydroartemisinin exposure. These findings contrast with other studies indicating NVP reduces or results in no change in exposure of antimalarial drugs, and may be specific to this age group (4-12 years). Considering the excellent safety profile of artemether-lumefantrine, the increase in lumefantrine is not of concern. However, the reduction in artemisinin exposure may warrant further study, and suggests that dosage adjustment of artemether-lumefantrine with nevirapine-based ART in children is likely warranted.

This study assessed the changes in maternal and newborn services in health facilities as well as demand for maternal and newborn health services in Eastern Uganda. Methods: The health assessment data were collected in August 2013 and September 2015 in the districts of Kamuli, Pallisa, and Kibuku. We purposively collected data on the availability of services from 40 health facilities that provided maternal and newborn services. In addition, we conducted 24 focus group discussions (FGDs) with women and men; and 18 key informant interviews (KIs) with health workers. Results: On the supply side, most health facilities persistently lacked lifesaving medicines such as misoprostol, IV Ampicillin, IV Gentamycin, IV Metronidazole, Magnesium Sulphate, Ergometrine, Corticosteroids, ferrous Sulphate, Folic Acid, Combined ferrous, Benzyl penicillin, and Diazepam (IM or IV). Basic newborn equipment such as stethoscope, fetal scope, working baby scale, newborn suction devices, newborn resuscitation device, and thermometer were persistently not available in most of the health facilities. Binders for Kangaroo Mother Care, blanket to wrap newborn, baby warmer or heat lamp were persistently not available in at least 80% of the health facilities. Other equipment for the management of labor and abortions such as Manual vacuum aspirator for abortion care, blank partographs and vacuum extractor were not available in most of the health facilities including referral facilities at baseline and follow-up. On the demand side, the qualitative interviews exposed long distances and inadequate transport to the health facilities, inadequate information, poverty, and poor services at the health facilities as major factors that impede women to utilize/accessmaternal and newborn services. Conclusion: There are distinct influences on both demand and supply side, which restrain both health care uptake and its quality. The frequent disparity between the health facility readiness to provide services and the women readiness to utilize them needs to be addressed as the country intensifies its efforts to reduce maternal and newborn deaths through boosting facility deliveries.

The integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) intervention of paediatric febrile illnesses though adopted by Uganda's Ministry of Health to be implemented by community health workers, has not addressed the in access to life-saving medicines and diagnostics. Therefore, the iCCM intervention was implemented in private drug shops and evaluated for its effect on appropriate treatment of paediatric fever in a low malaria transmission setting in South Western Uganda. Methods: From June 2013 to September 2015, the effect of the iCCM intervention on drug seller paediatric fever management and adherence to iCCM guidelines was assessed in a quasi-experimental study in South Western Uganda. A total of 212 care-seeker exit interviews were done before and 285 after in the intervention arm as compared to 216 before and 268 care-seeker interviews at the end of the study period in the comparison arm. The intervention effect was assessed by difference-in-difference analysis of drug seller treatment practices against national treatment recommendations between the intervention and comparison arms. Observed proportions among care-seeker interviews were compared with corresponding proportions from 5795 child visits recorded in patient registries and 49 direct observations of drug seller-care-seeker encounters in intervention drug shops. Results: The iCCM intervention increased the appropriate treatment of uncomplicated malaria, pneumonia symptoms and non-bloody diarrhoea by 80.2% (95% CI 53.2-107.2), 65.5% (95% CI 51.6-79.4) and 31.4% (95% CI 1.6-61.2), respectively. Within the intervention arm, drug seller scores on appropriate treatment for pneumonia symptoms and diagnostic test use were the same among care-seeker exit interviews and direct observation. A linear trend (negative slope, - 0.009 p value < 0.001) was observed for proportions of child cases prescribed any antimicrobial medicine in the intervention arm drug shops. Conclusions: The iCCM intervention improved appropriate treatment for uncomplicated malaria, pneumonia symptoms and diarrhoea. Drug seller adherence to iCCM guidelines was high, without causing excessive prescription of antimicrobial medicines in this study. Further research should assess whether this effect is sustained over time and under routine supervision models.

Objective: We sought to describe the rate and factors predicting specialist palliative referrals among cancer patients in Uganda. Design: We examined the rate of referrals of cancer patients to palliative specialists via a chart review, while also surveying and interviewing doctors at the Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI) about their approaches to palliative care. Setting: All adult patients at the UCI who died in a 20-month interval from 2014 to 2015. All UCI doctors were approached for the survey and 25 (96%) participated. Seven of these doctors were also individually interviewed. Measurements: Number of referrals to palliative specialists and qualitative responses to questions about end-of-life care management. Results: Sixty-six (11.1%) of 595 patients were referred to palliative care specialists. Patients with worse ECOG performance statuses were more likely to be referred to palliative specialists (odds ratio 2.23, p=0.03); no other factors were predictive of a referral. Median number of days lived after referral was 5 days (interquartile range 2-13). Doctors explained the low referral rate and short life expectancy after referral by limited palliative resources and a reticence to have end-of-life management conversations with patients due to cultural taboos. Conclusion: Despite recognized benefits of palliative collaboration, doctors at the UCI seldom refer patients to palliative care specialists due to limited staffing, cultural barriers, and difficult interservice communication.

In this study, we sought to determine whether subtype- specific differences are also observed among children receiving ART. Materials and Methods: Children were recruited from a clinical trial in which they were randomized to receive either lopinavir (LPV)-or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based ART (NCT00978068). Age at initiation of ART ranged from six months to six years. HIV subtype was determined by PCR amplification and population sequencing of the pol region derived from peripheral blood mononuclear cell DNA, followed by application of the REGA and Recombinant Identification Programme algorithms. General cognition was assessed using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (Second Edition), attention using the Test of Variables of Attention, and motor skills using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency (Second Edition). Home environment was assessed using the Home Observation for the Measurement of the Environment (HOME). Age-adjusted test z-scores were entered into a regression model that adjusted for sex, socio-economic status score, HOME score, years of schooling, and ART treatment type. Results: One hundred and five children were tested; median (interquartile range) age was 7.05 years (6.30 to 8.44), CD4 count was 867.7 cells/mm(3) (416.0 to 1203.5), and duration on ART was 4.03 years (3.55 to 4.23). Seventy-eight children had HIV subtype A and 27 had subtype D; the groups had comparable home and socio-economic status, except that there were more males among children infected with subtype A than D (64.7% vs. 35.3%, p = 0.02). There were no differences between the subtypes in general cognition (estimated mean difference: 0.20; 95% CI: -0.11 to 0.50); p = 0.21), attention (-0.18, 95% CI: -0.60 to 0.24, p = 0.41) and motor skills (1.60, 95% CI: -0.84 to 4.04, p = 0.20). Conclusions: Our results imply that ART may diminish the neurocognitive disadvantage seen in treatment-naive HIV-infected children with subtype A.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional research design was adopted which involved descriptive, correlation and regression approaches. Data were analysed through SPSS. Simple random sampling was used to select a sample of 40 MFIs from the population of 45 in Kampala and Wakiso districts. Findings: Results indicated that credit allocation and risk management had a significant relationship with loan portfolio performance. Results from the regression analysis showed that credit allocation and risk management significantly predicted 23.9% of loan portfolio performance. Practical implications: It was recommended that managers of the MFIs should conduct pre-disbursement trainings through workshops and seminars for all successful loan applicants which would enable them on how to utilize the loan facilities acquired which will eventually reduce on the default rates. Originality/value: This is one of the few studies that focus on credit allocation, risk management and loan portfolio performance of MFIs within the context of Uganda.

The Development of Plasmodium falciparum-specific IL10 CD4 T Cells and Protection from Malaria in Children in an Area of High Malaria Transmission	FRONTIERS IN IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article						Plasmodium falciparum; CD4 T cells; malaria; tolerance; interleukin 10	INOCULATION RATE; SEVERE DISEASE; 3 SITES; RESPONSES; IL-10; INFECTION; AGE; SUSCEPTIBILITY; AMPLIFICATION; ACTIVATION	Cytokine-producing CD4 T cells have important roles in immunity against Plasmodium falciparum (Pf) malaria. However, the factors influencing functional differentiation ofPfspecific CD4 T cells in naturally exposed children are not well understood. Moreover, it is not known which CD4 T-cell cytokine-producing subsets are most critical for protection. We measured Pf-specific IFN gamma-, IL10-, and TNF alpha-producing CD4 T-cell responses by multi-parametric flow cytometry in 265 children aged 6 months to 10 years enrolled in a longitudinal observational cohort in a high malaria transmission site in Uganda. We found that both age and parasite burden were independently associated with cytokine production by CD4 T cells. IL10 production by IFN gamma+ CD4 T cells was higher in younger children and in those with high-parasite burden during recent infection. To investigate the role of CD4 T cells in immunity to malaria, we measured associations of Pf-specific CD4 cytokine-producing cells with the prospective risk of Pf infection and clinical malaria, adjusting for household exposure to Pf-infected mosquitos. Overall, the prospective risk of infection was not associated with the total frequency of Pf-specific CD4 T cells, nor of any cytokine-producing CD4 subset. However, the frequency of CD4 cells producing IL10 but not inflammatory cytokines (IFN gamma and TNF alpha) was associated with a decreased risk of clinical malaria once infected. These data suggest that functional polarization of the CD4 T-cell response may modulate the clinical manifestations of malaria and play a role in naturally acquired immunity.

For health systems to effectively respond to the reproductive health needs of a growing youth population, it is imperative to understand their contraceptive needs and service seeking practices. This paper describes changes over time in contraceptive need, use, and sources of care among young women in four East African countries. Methods: We used three rounds of DHS data from Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda to examine time trends from 1999 to 2015 in met need for modern contraception, method mix, and source of care by sector (public or private) and type of provider among young women aged 15-24 years. We assessed disparities in contraceptive coverage improvements over time between younger (15-24 years) and older women (25-49 years) using a difference-in-differences approach. Results: Met need for contraception among women aged 15-24 years increased over time, ranging from a 20% increase in Tanzania to more than a 5-fold increase in Rwanda. Improvements in met need were greater among older women compared to younger women in Rwanda and Uganda, and higher among younger women in Kenya. Injectables have become the most popular contraceptive choice among young women, with more than 50% of modern contraceptive users aged 15-24 years currently using the method in all countries except for Tanzania, where condoms and injectables are used by 38% and 35% of young users, respectively. More than half of young women in Tanzania and Uganda receive contraceptives from the private sector; however, while the private sector played an important role in meeting the growing contraceptive needs among young women in Tanzania, increased use of public sector services drove expanded access in Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda. Conclusions: Our study shows that contraceptive use increased among young East African women, yet, unmet need remains high. As youth populations continue to grow, governments must develop more targeted strategies for expanding access to reproductive health services for young women. Engaging the private sector and task-shifting to lower-level providers offer promising approaches; however, additional research is needed to identify the key facilitators and barriers to the success of these strategies in different contexts.

Our aim was to document the effect of H. pylori infection on gestational weight gain (GWG) in a low-income urban setting in Uganda. Methods: This was a prospective cohort study conducted in Kampala between May 2012 and May 2013. The participants were HIV negative, H. pylori positive and H. pylori negative primigravidae and secundigravidae. Recruitment was at gestation age of eighteen or less weeks and follow up assessments were carried out at 26 and 36 weeks gestation age. H. pylori infection was determined using H. pylori stool antigen test. Maternal weight and height were measured, and body mass index (BMI) and rates of GWG were calculated. Results: The participants' mean +/- standard deviation (sd) age was 20.9 +/- 2.7 years. Primigravidae were 68.8% (n = 132) and 57.3% (n = 110) of the participants were positive for H. pylori infection. Low pre-pregnancy BMI (< 18.5 kg/m(2)) was recorded in 14.6% (n = 28). The mean +/- sd rate of GWG during second and third trimesters was 300.5 +/- 79.7 grams/week. The mean +/- sd weight gained by 36 weeks of gestation was 9.6 +/- 2.2 kg while gestation age at delivery was 39.4 +/- 1.0 weeks. Factors independently associated with the rates of GWG during the second and third trimesters were parity (P=0.023), H. pylori infection (P = 0.006), pre-pregnancy BMI (P = 0.037), height (P = 0.022) and household income (P = 0.003). Conclusion: H. pylori infection is associated with low rates of GWG among primigravidae and secundigravidae.

Objective: This study assessed uptake and correlates of cervical screening among HIV-infected women in care in Uganda. Methods: A nationally representative cross-sectional survey of HIV-infected women in care was conducted from August to November 2016. Structured interviews were conducted with 5198 women aged 15-49 years, from 245 HIV clinics. Knowledge and uptake of cervical screening and human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination were determined. Correlates of cervical screening were assessed with modified Poisson regression to obtain prevalence ratios (PRs) using Stata version 12.0. Results: Overall, 94.0% (n = 4858) had ever heard of cervical screening and 66% (n = 3732) knew a screening site. However, 47.4% (n = 2302) did not know the schedule for screening and 50% (n = 2409) did not know the symptoms of cervical cancer. One-third (33.7%; n = 1719) rated their risk of cervical cancer as low. Uptake of screening was 30.3% (n = 1561). Women who had never been screened cited lack of information (29.6%; n = 1059) and no time (25.5%; n = 913) as the main reasons. Increased likelihood of screening was associated with receipt of HIV care at a level II health center [adj. PR 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-2.76] and private facilities (adj. PR 1.68, 95% CI 1.16-3.21), knowledge of cervical screening (adj. PR 2.19, 95% CI 1.78-2.70), where to go for screening (adj. PR 6.47, 95% CI 3.69-11.36), and low perception of risk (adj. PR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14-2.03). HPV vaccination was 2%. Conclusions: Cervical screening and HPV vaccination uptake were very low among HIVinfected women in care in Uganda. Improved knowledge of cervical screening schedules and sites, and addressing fears and risk perception may increase uptake of cervical screening in this vulnerable population.

Impact of Intermittent Preventive Treatment During Pregnancy on Plasmodium falciparum Drug Resistance-Mediating Polymorphisms in Uganda	JOURNAL OF INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						P. falciparum; drug resistance; dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine; sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine; IPT	IN-VIVO SELECTION; DIHYDROARTEMISININ-PIPERAQUINE; ARTEMETHER-LUMEFANTRINE; SULFADOXINE-PYRIMETHAMINE; BURKINA-FASO; UNCOMPLICATED MALARIA; ARTEMISININ RESISTANCE; COMBINATION THERAPY; AMODIAQUINE; ALLELES	Background. In a recent trial of intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) in Uganda, dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) was superior to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) in preventing maternal and placental malaria. Methods. We compared genotypes using sequencing, fluorescent microsphere, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays at loci associated with drug resistance in Plasmodium falciparum isolated from subjects receiving DP or SP. Results. Considering aminoquinoline resistance, DP was associated with increased prevalences of mutations at pfmdr1 N86Y, pfmdr1 Y184F, and pfcrt K76T compared to SP (64.6% vs 27.4%, P < .001; 93.9% vs 59.2%, P < .001; and 87.7% vs 75.4%, P = .03, respectively). Increasing plasma piperaquine concentration at the time of parasitemia was associated with increasing pfmdr1 86Y prevalence; no infections with the N86 genotype occurred with piperaquine >2.75 ng/mL. pfkelch13 propeller domain polymorphisms previously associated with artemisinin resistance were not identified. Recently identified markers of piperaquine resistance were uncommon and not associated with DP. Considering antifolate resistance, SP was associated with increased prevalence of a 5-mutation haplotype (pfdhfr 51I, 59R, and 108N; pfdhps 437G and 581G) compared to DP (90.8% vs 60.0%, P = .001). Conclusions. IPTp selected for genotypes associated with decreased sensitivity to treatment regimens, but genotypes associated with clinically relevant DP resistance in Asia have not emerged in Uganda.

Reduced Frequency of Cells Latently Infected With Replication-Competent Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 in Virally Suppressed Individuals Living in Rakai, Uganda	CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						HIV-1; latent reservoir; viral outgrowth assay; sub-Saharan Africa; CD4 T cells	CD4(+) T-CELLS; ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HIV-1 INFECTION; RNA LEVELS; RESERVOIR; PERSISTENCE; IDENTIFICATION; PROLIFERATION; ERADICATION; PROGRESSION	Background. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) persists in latently infected resting CD4(+) T cells (rCD4 cells), posing a major barrier to curing HIV-1 infection. Previous studies have quantified this pool of latently infected cells in Americans; however, no study has quantified this reservoir in sub-Saharan Africans, who make up the largest population of HIV-1-infected individuals globally. Methods. Peripheral blood was collected from 70 virally suppressed HIV-1-infected individuals from Rakai District, Uganda, who had initiated antiretroviral therapy (ART) during chronic infection. The quantitative viral outgrowth assay was used to determine frequency of latently infected rCD4 cells containing replication-competent virus. Multivariate regression was used to identify correlates of reservoir size and to compare reservoir size between this Ugandan cohort and a previously studied cohort of individuals from Baltimore, Maryland. Results. The median frequency of latently infected rCD4 cells in this Ugandan cohort was 0.36 infectious units per million cells (IUPM; 95% confidence interval, 0.26-0.55 IUPM), 3-fold lower than the frequency observed in the Baltimore cohort (1.08 IUPM;.72-1.49 IUPM; P < .001). Reservoir size in Ugandans was correlated positively with set-point viral load and negatively with duration of viral suppression. Conclusions. Virally suppressed Ugandans had a 3-fold lower frequency of rCD4 cells latently infected with replication-competent HIV-1, compared with previous observations in a cohort of American patients, also treated with ART during chronic infection. The biological mechanism driving the observed smaller reservoir in Ugandans is of interest and may be of significance to HIV-1 eradication efforts.

Plasmodium falciparum EPCR-binding PfEMP1 expression increases with malaria disease severity and is elevated in retinopathy negative cerebral malaria	BMC MEDICINE			English	Article						Severe malaria; Cerebral malaria; Retinopathy; Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1(PfEMP1); Transcript levels	MEMBRANE PROTEIN-1 FAMILY; INFECTED ERYTHROCYTES; VAR GENES; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; ANTIGENIC VARIATION; CHILDHOOD MALARIA; C RECEPTOR; CHILDREN; PATHOGENESIS; DOMAINS	Background: Expression of group A and the A-like subset of group B Plasmodium falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) is associated with severe malaria (SM). The diversity of var sequences combined with the challenges of distinct classification of patient pathologies has made studying the role of distinct PfEMP1 variants on malaria disease severity challenging. The application of retinopathy in the recent years has provided a further method to clinically evaluate children with cerebral malaria (CM). The question of whether children with clinical CM but no retinopathy represent a completely different disease process or a subgroup within the spectrum of CM remains an important question in malaria. In the current study, we use newly designed primer sets with the best coverage to date in a large cohort of children with SM to determine the role of var genes in malaria disease severity and especially CM as discriminated by retinopathy. Methods: We performed qRT-PCR targeting the different subsets of these var genes on samples from Ugandan children with CM (n = 98, of whom 50 had malarial retinopathy [RP] and 47 did not [RN]), severe malarial anemia (SMA, n = 47), and asymptomatic parasitemia (AP, n = 14). The primers used in this study were designed based on var sequences from 226 Illumina whole genome sequenced P. falciparum field isolates. Results: Increasing severity of illness was associated with increasing levels of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR)-binding PfEMP1. EPCR-binding PfEMP1 transcript levels were highest in children with combined CM and SMA and then decreased by level of disease severity: RP CM > RN CM > SMA > AP. Conclusions: The study findings indicate that PfEMP1 binding to EPCR is important in the pathogenesis of SM, including RN CM, and suggest that increased expression of EPCR-binding PfEMP1 is associated with progressively more severe disease. Agents that block EPCR-binding of PfEMP1 could provide novel interventions to prevent or decrease disease severity in malaria.

Fragmentation of Forest Ecosystems and Connectivity Between Sacred Groves and Forest Reserves in Southeastern Benin, West Africa	TROPICAL CONSERVATION SCIENCE			English	Article						sacred groves; fragmentation; landscape connectivity; forest reserves; Guineo-Congolese	TROPICAL RAIN-FORESTS; BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION; VEGETATION INDEXES; LOCAL PERCEPTIONS; TREE DIVERSITY; HYPOTHESIS; DYNAMICS	An old yet appealing fact in conservation biology is the potential of sacred groves (SGs) and forest reserves (FRs) to harbor considerable biodiversity. Although fragmentation effects have been extensively investigated in several studies, the specific context pertaining to SG has rarely been discussed. Using data from two sites (Ketou and Pobe) in South Benin, we studied the similarities and connectivity between SG and FR, and the effects of fragmentation on forest ecosystems. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling and Moran index-based correlogram were used to analyze species-based similarities, distribution, and spatial autocorrelation. Fragmentation effects on characteristic species and forest structures were also tested. Results showed slightly greater similarity between SG and FR for Ketou SG-FR group compared with that of Pobe. Spatial association between SG and FR was also site specific and stronger in Pobe SG-FR group. The weak spatial dependence between SG and FR for the Ketou group reflects the state of degradation in the FR. Species richness and structural parameters were higher in SG than in FR for both sites. The results indicate that these forests emanated from fragmentation of primary forests and that the fragmentation effects were more pronounced in FR. The indicator species analysis further revealed some fragmentation effects on woody species composition, suggesting that forest isolation is potential threat for conservation of biological and structural diversity. In sum, this study shows that despite their limited spatial extent, SGs are key landscape features that play a vital role in local biodiversity conservation.	[Alohou, E. C.; Gbemavo, D. S. J.

Interruption of transmission of the disease by early diagnosis and treatment is core to the control and eventual elimination of gHAT. Until recently, the format of available screening tests had restricted screening and diagnosis to central health facilities (passive screening). We describe a novel strategy that is contributing to elimination of gHAT in Uganda through expansion of passive screening to the entire population at risk. Methodology / Principal findings In this strategy, patients who are clinically suspected of having gHAT at primary health facilities are screened using a rapid diagnostic test (RDT), followed by parasitological confirmation at strategically located microscopy centres. For patients who are positive with the RDT and negative by microscopy, blood samples undergo further testing using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), a molecular test that detects parasite DNA. LAMP positive patients are considered strong suspects, and are re-evaluated by microscopy. Location and upgrading of facilities to perform microscopy and LAMP was informed by results of georeferencing and characterization of all public healthcare facilities in the 7 gHAT endemic districts in Uganda. Three facilities were upgraded to perform RDTs, microscopy and LAMP, 9 to perform RDTs and microscopy, and 200 to screen patients with RDTs. This reduced the distance that a sick person must travel to be screened for gHAT to a median distance of 2.5km compared to 23km previously. In this strategy, 9 gHAT cases were diagnosed in 2014, and 4 in 2015. Conclusions This enhanced passive screening strategy for gHAT has enabled full coverage of the population at risk, and is being replicated in other gHAT endemic countries. The improvement in case detection is making elimination of the disease in Uganda an imminent possibility.

Each HHV causes a unique spectrum of disease depending on the infected individual's age and immunity. We collected weekly oral swabs from young children and mothers in 32 Ugandan households for a median of one year. We characterized kinetics of oral shedding during primary and chronic infection for each virus. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and HHV-6 were shed at high rates following primary infection. The rate of oral herpes simplex virus (HSV) shedding was lower overall, and children and mothers with chronic HSV infection had lower shedding rates than children with primary infection. CMV shedding rate and viral load were higher in children with primary infection compared to children with chronic infection, and even lower in mothers with chronic infection. HHV-6 shedding rate and viral load were similar between children with primary or chronic infection, but lower in mothers. EBV shedding rate and quantity decreased less dramatically in mothers versus children, with HIV-positive mothers shedding at a higher rate than HIV-negative mothers. Each HHV has a distinct pattern of oral shedding which depends partially on the age and immune status of the host.

Some cases may present with ear discharge through a tympanic membrane perforation which may heal spontaneously. However, up to 5% or more cases of those affected have persistent ear discharge. A number of barriers contribute towards delayed presentation at health facilities for treatment of ear infections. We conducted a study to evaluate parents' and caregivers' knowledge and care seeking practices for ear infections in children under five in Gasabo district in Kigali, Rwanda. Methods: Parents/guardians (n = 810) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to elicit their knowledge of ear infections in children under five and their attitude to seeking care for their children. Results: The mean age of the respondents was 31.27 years (SD = 7.88, range 17-83). Considering an average of knowledge parameters which included causes, symptoms, prevention, treatment and consequences of ear infections, we found that 76.6% (622) of respondents were knowledgeable about ear infections. We defined a positive practice as seeking medical treatment (community health workers or health facility) and this was found in 89.1% (722) respondents. Correlating knowledge with choice of seeking treatment, respondents were 33% less likely to practice medical pluralism (OR = 0.33, CI 0.11-0.97, P = 0.043) if they were familiar with infections. Moreover, urban dweller were 1.7 times more likely to know ear infections compared to rural dwellers (OR = 1.70, CI 1.22-2.38, P = 0.002). Conclusion: The majority of respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes and practices about ear infection. However, medical pluralism was common. There is need to improve the community's awareness and access to primary health care facilities for the care of ear infections especially in rural areas of Rwanda.

Relationships between infection with Plasmodium falciparum during pregnancy, measures of placental malaria, and adverse birth outcomes	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Malaria; Pregnancy; Placental malaria; Birth outcomes; Asymptomatic parasitaemia; IPTp; Low birth weight; Small for gestational age; Preterm birth; LAMP	GESTATIONAL-AGE; WEIGHT; TRANSMISSION; PERFORMANCE; MORTALITY; PRETERM; INFANTS; AFRICA; BURDEN; UGANDA	Background: Malaria in pregnancy has been associated with maternal morbidity, placental malaria, and adverse birth outcomes. However, data are limited on the relationships between longitudinal measures of malaria during pregnancy, measures of placental malaria, and birth outcomes. Methods: This is a nested observational study of data from a randomized controlled trial of intermittent preventive therapy during pregnancy among 282 participants with assessment of placental malaria and delivery outcomes. HIV-uninfected pregnant women were enrolled at 12-20 weeks of gestation. Symptomatic malaria during pregnancy was measured using passive surveillance and monthly detection of asymptomatic parasitaemia using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Placental malaria was defined as either the presence of parasites in placental blood by microscopy, detection of parasites in placental blood by LAMP, or histopathologic evidence of parasites or pigment. Adverse birth outcomes assessed included low birth weight (LBW), preterm birth (PTB), and small for gestational age (SGA) infants. Results: The 282 women were divided into three groups representing increasing malaria burden during pregnancy. Fifty-two (18.4%) had no episodes of symptomatic malaria or asymptomatic parasitaemia during the pregnancy, 157 (55.7%) had low malaria burden (0-1 episodes of symptomatic malaria and < 50% of samples LAMP+), and 73 (25.9%) had high malaria burden during pregnancy (>= 2 episodes of symptomatic malaria or >= 50% of samples LAMP+). Women with high malaria burden had increased risks of placental malaria by blood microscopy and LAMP [aRR 14.2 (1.80-111.6) and 4.06 (1.73-9.51), respectively], compared to the other two groups combined. Compared with women with no malaria exposure during pregnancy, the risk of placental malaria by histopathology was higher among low and high burden groups [aRR = 3.27 (1.32-8.12) and aRR = 7.07 (2.84-17.6), respectively]. Detection of placental parasites by any method was significantly associated with PTB [aRR 5.64 (1.46-21.8)], and with a trend towards increased risk for LBW and SGA irrespective of the level of malaria burden during pregnancy. Conclusion: Higher malaria burden during pregnancy was associated with placental malaria and together with the detection of parasites in the placenta were associated with increased risk for adverse birth outcomes.

Improving the quality of maternity services in Uganda through accelerated implementation of essential interventions by healthcare professional associations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GYNECOLOGY & OBSTETRICS			English	Article						Childbirth; Essential interventions; Health provider; Neonatal health; Professional associations		Objective: To assess whether the implementation of a package of activities through the joint action of the three international healthcare professionals associations (HCPAs) increased the use of intrapartum and postnatal essential interventions (EIs) in two hospitals in Uganda. Methods: A non-controlled before-and-after study was undertaken to evaluate the effect of a package of activities designed to change practice relating to nine EIs among providers. Coverage of the EIs was measured in a 3-month pre-implementation period and a 3-month post-implementation period in 2014. Data were obtained for women older than 18 years who delivered vaginally or by cesarean. Results: Overall, 4816 women were included. Level of use remained high for EIs used widely at baseline. Some EIs that had low use at baseline did not show improvement after the implementation. Promotion of breastfeeding showed a significant improvement in the Kampala hospital, from 8.5% (8/94) to 25.6% (30/117; P=0.001), whereas promotion of hygiene in cord care improved at the Mbarara hospital, from 0.1% (2/1592) to 46.0% (622/1351; P<0.001). Conclusion: These exploratory results show that a package delivered through the joint work of the three HCPAs was feasible to implement along with rigorous data collection. Although the data show disparities, trends suggest that improvement could be achieved.

A total of 55 unlined pit latrines, 7 private and 8 rental unlined pit latrines were sampled in the first and second phases (representing the rainy season) and 40 pits in the third phase (representing dry season), and analysed for indicator organisms and pathogens from 4 pit latrine sludge layers, at depths of 0, 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 m, following APHA standard methods. Physico-chemical parameters of the faecal sludge were also measured. Three sampling phases were undertaken to determine the effect of seasonal variation. Results indicate that the mean temperature and pH were 25.4 +/- 1.4 degrees C and 8.0 +/- 1.5, respectively; and moisture content increased with pit sludge depth, except between Depths 3 and 4. Average moisture content was 86.3 +/- 3%. The measured parameters varied significantly (P > 0.05) between seasons. The mean reduction in total coliforms, thermo-tolerant coliforms, E. coli, and faecal enterococci with sludge depth was significant at all depths (P < 0.05), but the least significant difference was not significant at depth levels of 1.0 m and 1.5 m. Salmonella was only detected at the top layer of faecal sludge in 60% of Phase 2 samples and in only 20% of the samples in Phase 3. About 200-4100 eggs/g of strongyles were found in 98% of the samples and 100-1600 eggs/g of ascarids in 55% of the samples. Temperature, pH and moisture content did not show a significant correlation with observed reductions of indicators and pathogens. With extrapolation of the generated regression models, a pit of 8 m can be recommended for reduction of bacteria. It is recommended that protective field gear be used during pit emptying and that faecal sludge treatment should be done to reduce pathogens before disposal into the environment.

Design: A secondary analysis of women participating in MTN-020/ASPIRE, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of the dapivirine vaginal ring for HIV-1 prevention. Methods: Use of a highly effective method of contraception was an eligibility criterion for study participation. Urine pregnancy tests were performed monthly. Pregnancy incidence by arm was calculated separately for each hormonal contraceptive method and compared using an Andersen-Gill proportional hazards model stratified by site and censored at HIV-1 infection. Results: Of 2629 women enrolled, 2310 women returned for follow-up and reported using a hormonal contraceptive method at any point during study participation (1139 in the dapivirine arm and 1171 in the placebo arm). Pregnancy incidence in the dapivirine arm versus placebo among women using injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate was 0.43% vs. 0.54%, among women using injectable norethisterone enanthate was 1.15% vs. 0%, among women using hormonal implants was 0.22% vs. 0.69%, and among women using oral contraceptive pills was 32.26% vs. 28.01%. Pregnancy incidence did not differ by study arm for any of the hormonal contraceptive methods. Conclusions: Use of the dapivirine ring does not reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives for pregnancy prevention. Oral contraceptive pill use was associated with high pregnancy incidence, potentially because of poor pill adherence. Injectable and implantable methods were highly effective in preventing pregnancy.

The Simple AMplification-Based Assay (SAMBA) HIV-1 Qual Whole Blood Test was developed specifically for early infant diagnosis and prevention of mother-to-child transmission programs implemented at the point-of-care in resource-limited settings. Methods: We have evaluated the performance of this test run on the SAMBA I semiautomated platform with fresh whole blood specimens collected from 202 adults and 745 infants in Kenya, Uganda, and Zimbabwe. Results were compared with those obtained with the Roche COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan (CAP/CTM) HIV-1 assay as performed with fresh whole blood or dried blood spots of the same subjects, and discrepancies were resolved with alternative assays. Results: The performance of the SAMBA and CAP/CTM assays evaluated at 5 laboratories in the 3 countries was similar for both adult and infant samples. The clinical sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the SAMBA test were 100%, 99.2%, 98.7%, and 100%, respectively, with adult samples, and 98.5%, 99.8%, 99.7%, and 98.8%, respectively, with infant samples. Discussion: Our data suggest that the SAMBA HIV-1 Qual Whole Blood Test would be effective for early diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in infants at point-of-care settings in sub-Saharan Africa.

A Process Evaluation to Assess Contextual Factors Associated With the Uptake of a Rapid Response Service to Support Health Systems' Decision-Making in Uganda	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH POLICY AND MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Evidence-Informed Health Policy; Knowledge Translation (KT); Rapid Response Services (RRSs); Innovations; Process Evaluations	IMPLEMENTATION; ORGANIZATIONS; INNOVATIONS; POLICY	Background: Although proven feasible, rapid response services (RRSs) to support urgent decision and policymaking are still a fairly new and innovative strategy in several health systems, more especially in low-income countries. There are several information gaps about these RRSs that exist including the factors that make them work in different contexts and in addition what affects their uptake by potential end users. Methods: We used a case study employing process evaluation methods to determine what contextual factors affect the utilization of a RRS in Uganda. We held in-depth interviews with researchers, knowledge translation (KT) specialists and policy-makers from several research and policy-making institutions in Uganda's health sector. We analyzed the data using thematic analysis to develop categories and themes about activities and structures under given program components that affected uptake of the service. Results: We identified several factors under three themes that have both overlapping relations and also reinforcing loops amplifying each other: Internal factors (those factors that were identified as over which the RRS had full [or almost full] control); external factors (factors over which the service had only partial influence, a second party holds part of this influence); and environmental factors (factors over which the service had no or only remote control if at all). Internal factors were the design of the service and resources available for it, while the external factors were the service's visibility, integrity and relationships. Environmental factors were political will and health system policy and decision-making infrastructure. Conclusion: For health systems practitioners considering RRSs, knowing what factors will affect uptake and therefore modifying them within their contexts is important to ensure efficient use and successful utilization of the mechanisms.

Geospatial analysis of unmet pediatric surgical need in Uganda	JOURNAL OF PEDIATRIC SURGERY			English	Article						Disease burden; SOSAS; Global surgery; Community survey; Low; and middle-income countries; Sub-Saharan Africa; Geospatial	HOUSEHOLD SURVEY; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; SIERRA-LEONE; CHILDREN	Background: In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), an estimated 85% of children do not have access to surgical care. The objective of the current study was to determine the geographic distribution of surgical conditions among children throughout Uganda. Methods: Using the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need (SOSAS) survey, we enumerated 2176 children in 2315 households throughout Uganda. At the district level, we determined the spatial autocorrelation of surgical need with geographic access to surgical centers variable. Findings: The highest average distance to a surgical center was found in the northern region at 14.97 km (95% CI: 11.29 km-16.89 km). Younger children less than five years old had a higher prevalence of unmet surgical need in all four regions than their older counterparts. The spatial regression model showed that distance to surgical center and care availability were the main spatial predictors of unmet surgical need. Interpretation: We found differences in unmet surgical need by region and age group of the children, which could serve as priority areas for focused interventions to alleviate the burden. Future studies could be conducted in the northern regions to develop targeted interventions aimed at increasing pediatric surgical care in the areas of most need. Level of Evidence: Level III.

For more than half a century, urban centers have been on the receiving end of internal migrants in Ghana with Accra, Kumasi, and Sekondi-Takoradi receiving the lion's share. However, a lot of migrants end up in poor neighborhoods due to inability to afford relatively costly rents in the better residential areas in the cities. Migrants who live on the margins of society are adversely impacted by poor environmental conditions that make them susceptible to environmentally-induced diseases such as malaria, cholera, and typhoid. While the poverty, health, and place research in Accra, Ghana, have focused on spatial distribution of inequalities in health, burden of sexual ill health, double burden of diseases, environment, wealth and health relationship, as well as income and health connections, there is paucity of research on association between the daily lifestyles of migrants in poor urban neighborhoods and their health status. Specifically on lifestyle and contextual factors, we examine (1) eating and drinking behavior, (2) perception of environmental factors, (3) attitudes and practices during illnesses, and (4) physical activities. Results from Ordinal Logit Regression models suggest that the key predictors of self-rated health status are: (1) socio-demographic elements like length of stay, job type, and religiosity; and (2) eating and drinking behavior-frequency of buying food from food vendors, and (3) social capital.

To inform programme planning and decision making, additional economic and financial costs of community and facility components were estimated from the perspective of the provider using the Excel-based Cost of Integrating Newborn Care Tool. Additional costs excluded costs already paid by the government for the routine health system and covered design, set-up, and 1-year implementation phases. Improved efficiency was modelled by reducing the number of VHT per village from two to one and varying the number of home visits/mother, the programme's financial cost at scale was projected (population of 100 000). 92% of expectant mothers (n = 1584) in the intervention area were attended by VHTs who performed an average of three home visits per mother. The annualized additional financial cost of the programme was $83 360 of which 4% ($3266) was for design, 24% ($20 026) for set-up and 72% ($60 068) for implementation. 56% ($47 030) went towards health facility strengthening, whereas 44% ($36 330) was spent at the community level. The average cost/mother for the community programme, excluding one-off design costs, amounted to $22.70 and the average cost per home visit was $7.50. The additional cost of the preventive home visit programme staffed by volunteer VHTs represents $1.04 per capita, 1.8% of Uganda's public health expenditure per capita ($59.00). If VHTs were to spend an average of 6 h a week on the programme, costs per mother would drop to $13.00 and cost per home visit to $3.20, in a population of 100 000 at 95% coverage.

J	Nargis, N; Nyamurungi, K; Baine, SO; Kadobera, D				Nargis, Nigar; Nyamurungi, Kellen; Baine, Sebastian Olakira; Kadobera, Daniel			The health cost of tobacco use in Uganda	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Cost-of-illness; tobacco use; health care cost; morbidity; mortality	ECONOMIC-ASPECTS; SMOKING; BURDEN; DISEASE; COUNTRIES; MORTALITY; AFRICA; IMPACT	The economic cost of tobacco use is well documented in high-income countries. It has been measured in relatively fewer low-and middle-income countries, and much less in sub-Saharan Africa despite the longstanding recognition of significant current and future health risk to people attributed by tobacco use in this region. This article fills this gap by estimating the economic cost of tobacco use in Uganda, a low-income country in sub-Saharan Africa. This study estimates the economic cost of tobacco use in Uganda using the cost-of-illnesses approach based on data collected from a survey of patients and caregivers in four major service centers in Mulago National Referral Hospital, namely, Uganda Cancer Institute, Uganda Heart Institute, Chest Clinic and Diabetic Clinic, key informant interviews and secondary sources for the year 2014. The total direct health care and non-health care cost of tobacco-related illnesses in Uganda was USD 41.56 million. The total indirect morbidity and mortality costs from the loss of productivity due to tobacco-related illnesses were USD 11.91 million and USD 73.01 million, respectively. The direct and indirect costs of tobacco use added up to USD 126.48 million, which is equivalent to 0.5% of GDP, a proportion comparable to the estimated health cost of tobacco use in other countries. The total health care cost of tobacco-related illnesses constitutes 2.3% of the national health care account which is already over-burdened with the cost of infectious diseases, limited medical personnel and infrastructure. In addition, tobacco-related illnesses heavily reduce life expectancy of tobacco users and ultimately their economic productivity. The cost of tobacco-related illnesses in Uganda far outweighs the benefits of employment and tax revenue generated from the tobacco sector. Stronger tobacco control measures need to be undertaken to reduce the disease and economic burden of tobacco use in this country.

The objective of this study was to assess the inter-organization infrastructure that supports the provision of selected health services in the reconstruction phase after conflict in northern Uganda. Applied social network analysis was used to establish the structure, size and function among organizations supporting the provision of (1) HIV treatment, (2) maternal delivery services and (3) workforce strengthening. Overall, 87 organizations were identified from 48 respondent organizations in the three post-conflict districts in northern Uganda. A two-stage snowball approach was used starting with service provider organizations in each district. Data included a list of organizations and their key attributes related to the provision of each service for the year 2012-13. The findings show that inter-organization networks are mostly focused on HIV treatment and least for workforce strengthening. The networks for HIV treatment and maternal services were about 3-4 times denser relative to the network for workforce strengthening. The network for HIV treatment accounted for 69-81% of the aggregated network in Gulu and Kitgum districts. In contrast, the network for workforce strengthening contributed the least (6% and 10%) in these two districts. Likewise, the networks supporting a young district (Amuru) was under invested with few organizations and sparse connections. Overall, organizations exhibited a broad range of functional roles in supporting HIV treatment compared to other services in the study. Basic information about the inter-organization setup (infrastructure)-can contribute to knowledge for building organization networks in more equitable ways. More connected organizations can be leveraged for faster communication and resource flow to boost the delivery of health services.

We followed ART-naive HIV-infected patients initiating antiretroviral therapy in an HIV clinic in Gabon, for 6 months. Among 101 patients, IRIS was diagnosed in five. All IRIS cases were mucocutaneous manifestations. There were no cases of tuberculosis (TB) IRIS, but active TB (n = 20) was associated with developing other forms of IRIS (p = 0.02). Six patients died. The incidence of IRIS is low in Gabon, with mild, mucocutaneous manifestations.	[Janssen, S.; Osbak, K.; Moekotte, A.; Knap, M.; van Vugt, M.; Grobusch, M.

However, its control approach does not include adult individuals who are equally at risk and infected. To justify the inclusion of adult individuals in MDA programs in Tanzania, the present study focused on determining the prevalence of S. mansoni infection and its related morbidities among adult individuals. This was a cross sectional study conducted among 412 adult individuals aged 18-89 years living in selected villages of Rorya and Butiama districts located along the shoreline of the Lake Victoria. A pretested questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and socio-economic information of participants. Ultrasonographic examinations were conducted for all study participants using the Niamey protocol. A single stool sample was obtained from all study participants and examined for S. mansoni using the Kato-Katz technique. The study revealed a high prevalence of S. mansoni (56.3%), and the majority of infected individuals had a light intensity of infection. Ultrasonographic findings revealed that 22.4% of adult individuals had periportal fibrosis (PPF) (grade C-F), with 18.4% having grade C and D and 4% having grade E and F. Males had the highest prevalence of PPF (31.7% vs 10.8%, P < 0.001). Organomegaly was common with 28.5% and 29.6% having splenomegaly and hepatomegaly, respectively. S. mansoni infection and its related morbidities included PPF, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly were common among adult individuals. To reduce the level of transmission of S. mansoni infection, planned mass drug administration campaigns should include adult individuals living in these villages.

Long regarded as an invariably fatal disease, there is increasing evidence that infection by T.b. gambiense can result in a wide range of clinical outcomes, including latent infections, which are long lasting infections with no parasites detectable by microscopy. The determinants of this clinical diversity are not well understood but could be due in part to parasite or host genetic diversity in multiple genes, or their interactions. A candidate gene association study was conducted in Cote d'Ivoire using a case-control design which included a total of 233 subjects (100 active HAT cases, 100 controls and 33 latent infections). All three possible pairwise comparisons between the three phenotypes were tested using 96 SNPs in 16 candidate genes (IL1, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL10, IL12, IL12R, TNFA, INFG, MIF, APOL1, HPR, CFH, HLA-A and HLA-G). Data from 77 SNPs passed quality control. There were suggestive associations at three loci in IL6 and TNFA in the comparison between active cases and controls, one SNP in each of APOL1, MIF and IL6 in the comparison between latent infections and active cases and seven SNP in IL4, HLA-G and TNFA between latent infections and controls. No associations remained significant after Bonferroni correction, but the Benjamini Hochberg false discovery rate test indicated that there were strong probabilities that at least some of the associations were genuine. The excess of associations with latent infections despite the small number of samples available suggests that these subjects form a distinct genetic cluster different from active HAT cases and controls, although no clustering by phenotype was observed by principle component analysis. This underlines the complexity of the interactions existing between host genetic polymorphisms and parasite diversity.

Elimination requires a better understanding of the epidemiology and clinical evolution of HAT. In addition to the classical clinical evolution of HAT, asymptomatic carriers and spontaneous cure have been reported in West Africa. A genetic component to human susceptibility to HAT has been suggested to explain these newly observed responses to infection. In order to test for genetic associations with infection response, genetic polymorphism in 17 genes were tested (APOL1, IL1B, IL4, IL4R, IL6, IL8, IL12B, IL12RB1, IL10, TNFA, INFG, MIF, HLA-G, HLA-A, HP, HPR and CFH). Methodology A case-control study was performed on 180 blood samples collected from 56 cases and 124 controls from Cameroon. DNA was extracted from blood samples. After quality control, 25 samples (24 controls and 1 case) were eliminated. The genotyping undertaken on 155 individuals including 55 cases and 100 controls were investigated at 96 loci (88 SNPs and 8 indels) located on 17 genes. Associations between these loci and HAT were estimated via a case-control association test. Results Analyses of 64 SNPs and 4 indels out of 96 identified in the selected genes reveal that the minor allele (T) of rs8062041 in haptoglobin (HP) appeared to be protective against HAT (p = 0.0002395, OR 0.359 (CI95 [0.204-0.6319])); indicating higher frequency in cases compared to controls. This minor allele with adjusted p value of 0.0163 is associated with a lower risk (protective effect) of developing sleeping sickness. Conclusion The haptoglobin related protein HPR and HP are tightly linked and both are duplicated in some people and may lead to higher activity. This increased production could be responsible of the protection associated with rs8062041 even though this SNP is within HP.

Institutional partnerships are the cornerstone of sustainable education, research, clinical service, and advocacy for GCH. When successful, partnerships can become self-sustaining and support development of much-needed training programs in resource-constrained settings. Conversely, poorly conceptualized, constructed, or maintained partnerships may inadvertently contribute to the deterioration of health systems. In this comprehensive, literature-based, expert consensus review we present a definition of partnerships for GCH, review their genesis, evolution, and scope, describe participating organizations, and highlight benefits and challenges associated with GCH partnerships. Additionally, we suggest a framework for applying sound ethical and public health principles for GCH that includes 7 guiding principles and 4 core practices along with a structure for evaluating GCH partnerships. Finally, we highlight current knowledge gaps to stimulate further work in these areas. With awareness of the potential benefits and challenges of GCH partnerships, as well as shared dedication to guiding principles and core practices, GCH partnerships hold vast potential to positively impact child health.

However, little is known about how refugees enter these markets, how they fare in relation to host populations and internally displaced persons (IDPs), and how municipal and humanitarian actors might intervene to improve their outcomes. This paper examines the participation of refugee and IDP populations in markets in Kampala - the capital of a country with one of the largest refugee populations in the world. It investigates the experiences of Acholi, Somali and Congolese populations in the paper bead, bitenge fabric and cosmetics markets, respectively. Considerable diversity is found in the experiences of these different populations, relating to their access to basic services, supply chains, and diasporic networks.

Nosema neumanni n. sp (Microsporidia, Nosematidae), a new microsporidian parasite of honeybees, Apis mellifera in Uganda	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PROTISTOLOGY			English	Article						African honeybee; Microsporidia; Nosematidae; Nosemosis; 16 SSU RNA; Ultra-structure	CERANAE MICROSPORIDIA; BEE COLONIES; INFECTION; SEQUENCE; EUROPE	The microsporidium Nosema neumanni n. sp., a new parasite of the honeybee Apis mellifera is described based on its ultra structural and molecular characteristics. Structures resembling microsporidian spores were found by microscopic examination of honeybees from Uganda. Molecular confirmation failed when PCR primers specific for Nosema apis and Nosema ceranae were used, but was successful with primers covering the whole family of Nosematidae. We performed transmission electron microscopy and found typical microsporidian spores which were smaller (length: 2.36 +/- 0.14 m and width: 1.78 +/- 0.06 p.m; n = 6) and had fewer polar filament coils (10-12) when compared to those of known species infecting honeybees. The entire 16S SS(J rRNA region was amplified, cloned and sequenced and was found to be unique with the highest resemblance (97% identity) to N. apis, The incidence of N. neumanni n. sp. in Ugandan honeybees was found to be much higher than of the two other Nosema species.

Overview, methods and results of multi-country community-based maternal and newborn care economic analysis	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Community-based; community health workers; newborn; maternal health; economic analysis; cost analysis; costing tool; health systems; developing country; effectiveness threshold	NEONATAL-MORTALITY; COST-EFFECTIVENESS; WOMENS GROUPS; CHILD HEALTH; TRIAL; INTERVENTION; PACKAGE; MANAGEMENT; MALAWI	Home visits for pregnancy and postnatal care were endorsed by the WHO and partners as a complementary strategy to facility-based care to reduce newborn and maternal mortality. This article aims to synthesise findings and implications from the economic analyses of community-based maternal and newborn care (CBMNC) evaluations in seven countries. The evaluations included five cluster randomized trials (Ethiopia, Ghana, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda) and programmatic before/after assessments (Bolivia, Malawi). The economic analyses were undertaken using a standardized, comparable methodology the 'Cost of Integrated Newborn Care' Tool, developed by the South African Medical Research Council, with Saving Newborn Lives and a network of African economists. The main driver of costs is the number of community health workers (CHWs), determined by their time availability, as fixed costs per CHW (equipment, training, salary/stipend, supervision and management), independent from the level of activity (number of mothers visited) represented over 96% of economic and financial costs in five of the countries. Unpaid volunteers are not necessarily a cheap option. An integrated programme with multi-purpose paid workers usually has lower costs per visit but requires innovative management, including supervision to ensure that coverage, or quality of care are not compromised since these workers have many other responsibilities apart from maternal and newborn health. If CHWs reach 95% of pregnant women in a standardized 100 000 population, the additional financial cost in all cases would be under USD1 per capita. In five of the six countries, the programme would be highly cost-effective (cost per DALY averted < GDP/capita) by WHO threshold even if they only achieved a reduction of 1 neonatal death per 1000 live births. These results contribute useful information for implementation planning and sustainability of CBMNC programmes.

Coin Care Tool Grp	Multi-country analysis of the cost of community health workers kits and commodities for community-based maternal and newborn care	HEALTH POLICY AND PLANNING			English	Article						Community health workers; commodities; home visit kits; economic evaluation; costing; scale-up; home-visits; maternal and newborn	HOME-VISITS; SOUTH-AFRICA; TRIAL; CHILD; GOODSTART; PACKAGE; HIV	Community-based maternal and newborn care with home visits by community health workers (CHWs) are recommended by WHO to complement facility-based care. As part of multi-country economic and systems analyses, we aimed to compare the content and financial costs associated with equipping CHWs or 'home visit kits' from seven studies in Bolivia, Ethiopia, Ghana, Malawi, South Africa, Tanzania and Uganda. We estimated the equivalent annual costs (EACs) of home visit kits per CHW in constant 2015 USD. We estimated EAC at scale in a population of 100 000 assuming four home visits per mother during the pregnancy and postnatal period. All seven packages were designed for health promotion; six included clinical assessments and one included curative care. The items used by CHWs differed between countries, even for the same task. The EAC per home visit kit ranged from $15 in Tanzania to $116 in South Africa. For health promotion and preventive care, between 82 and 100% of the cost of CHW commodities did not vary with the number of home visits conducted; however, in Ethiopia, the majority of EAC associated with curative care varied with the number of visits conducted. The EAC of equipping CHWs to meet the needs of 95% of expectant mothers in a catchment area of 100 000 people was highest in Bolivia, $40 260 for 633 CHWs, due to mothers being in hard-to-reach areas with CHW conducting few visits per year per, and lowest in Tanzania ($2693 for 172 CHWs), due to the greater number of CHW visits per week and lower EAC of items. To inform and ensure sustainable implementation at scale, national discussions regarding the cadre of CHWs and their workload should also consider carefully the composition and cost of equipping CHWs to carry out their work effectively and efficiently.

Trends in obesity and diabetes across Africa from 1980 to 2014: an analysis of pooled population-based studies	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Article						Diabetes; adiposity; body mass index; Africa; prevalence; trends	PREVALENCE; MELLITUS; GLUCOSE	Background: The 2016 Dar Es Salaam Call to Action on Diabetes and Other non-communicable diseases (NCDs) advocates national multi-sectoral NCD strategies and action plans based on available data and information from countries of sub-Saharan Africa and beyond. We estimated trends from 1980 to 2014 in age-standardized mean body mass index (BMI) and diabetes prevalence in these countries, in order to assess the coprogression and assist policy formulation. Methods: We pooled data from African and worldwide population-based studies which measured height, weight and biomarkers to assess diabetes status in adults aged >= 18 years. A Bayesian hierarchical model was used to estimate trends by sex for 200 countries and territories including 53 countries across five African regions (central, eastern, northern, southern and western), in mean BMI and diabetes prevalence (defined as either fasting plasma glucose of >= 7.0 mmol/l, history of diabetes diagnosis, or use of insulin or oral glucose control agents). Results: African data came from 245 population-based surveys (1.2 million participants) for BMI and 76 surveys (182 000 participants) for diabetes prevalence estimates. Countries with the highest number of data sources for BMI were South Africa (n = 17), Nigeria (n = 15) and Egypt (n = 13); and for diabetes estimates, Tanzania (n = 8), Tunisia (n = 7), and Cameroon, Egypt and South Africa (all n = 6). The age-standardized mean BMI increased from 21.0 kg/m(2) (95% credible interval: 20.3-21.7) to 23.0 kg/m(2) (22.7-23.3) in men, and from 21.9 kg/m(2) (21.3-22.5) to 24.9 kg/m(2) (24.6-25.1) in women. The age-standardized prevalence of diabetes increased from 3.4% (1.5-6.3) to 8.5% (6.5-10.8) in men, and from 4.1% (2.0-7.5) to 8.9% (6.9-11.2) in women. Estimates in northern and southern regions were mostly higher than the global average; those in central, eastern and western regions were lower than global averages. A positive association (correlation coefficient similar or equal to 0.9) was observed between mean BMI and diabetes prevalence in both sexes in 1980 and 2014. Conclusions: These estimates, based on limited data sources, confirm the rapidly increasing burden of diabetes in Africa. This rise is being driven, at least in part, by increasing adiposity, with regional variations in observed trends. African countries' efforts to prevent and control diabetes and obesity should integrate the setting up of reliable monitoring systems, consistent with the World Health Organization's Global Monitoring System Framework.

The purpose of this study was to explore factors influencing male support for women's reproductive health services and to elicit suggestions for strategies to increase male involvement. In 2008-2009, focus groups (N = 76) were conducted with men and women in a rural hospital in Uganda. A content analysis approach was used for data analysis. Our findings point to the need for multi-level approaches that educate and mobilize men, while improving quality of care at the facility level to increase male involvement in reproductive health services.

Interventions such as provision and use of safe water, minimising contact with infested water, disposal of stool in latrines and snail control provide key avenues to break the transmission cycle and can sustain the benefits of mass treatment in the long term. Efforts are also being made to develop a schistosomiasis vaccine which, if effective, might reduce the incidence of re-infection after treatment. However, any interventions deployed need to be acceptable to, and sustainable by, the target communities. Methods In this qualitative study, we investigated the perceptions of six Lake Victoria island communities of Koome, Uganda, about interventions to control Schistosoma mansoni infection and their willingness to participate in Schistosoma vaccine trials. Thirty-two in-depth interviews, 12 key informant interviews and 10 focus group discussions were conducted. Data were analysed using a thematic content approach. Findings Intestinal schistosomiasis was not regarded as a serious health problem because a mass treatment programme is in place. However, the communities lack safe water sources and latrines. Mass treatment with praziquantel, safe water supplies and use of toilets were deemed the most acceptable interventions by the participants. The communities are willing to participate in Schistosoma vaccine trials. Conclusion/Significance Knowledge of a community's perception about interventions to control schistosomiasis can be valuable to policy makers and programme implementers intending to set up interventions	[Sanya, Richard E.; Elliott, Alison M.] Uganda Virus Res Inst, MRC, Immunomodulat & Vaccines Programme, Uganda Res Unit,UVRI, Entebbe, Uganda; [Sanya, Richard E.] Makerere Univ, Dept Internal Med, Coll Hlth Sci, Kampala, Uganda; [Tumwesige, Edward; Seeley, Janet] Uganda Virus Res Inst, MRC, Social Aspects Hlth Programme, Uganda Res Unit,UVRI, Entebbe, Uganda; [Elliott, Alison M.] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Clin Res, London, England; [Seeley, Janet] London Sch Hyg & Trop Med, Dept Global Hlth & Dev, London, England	Sanya, RE (corresponding author), Uganda Virus Res Inst, MRC, Immunomodulat & Vaccines Programme, Uganda Res Unit,UVRI, Entebbe, Uganda.; Sanya, RE (corresponding author), Makerere Univ, Dept Internal Med, Coll Hlth Sci, Kampala, Uganda.	sanyarich@gmail.com		Elliott, Alison/0000-0003-2818-9549; Sanya, Richard/0000-0001-6348-9075; Seeley, Janet/0000-0002-0583-5272	Wellcome TrustWellcome Trust [095778, 107743]; UK Medical Research Council (MRC)Medical Research Council UK (MRC); UK Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordat; European UnionEuropean Union (EU); DELTAS Africa Initiative [107743]; African Academy of Sciences (AAS)'s Alliance for Accelerating Excellence in Science in Africa (AESA); New Partnership for Africa's Development Planning and Coordinating Agency (NEPAD Agency); UK government	This work was supported by the Wellcome Trust (grant number 095778), the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the UK Department for International Development (DFID) under the MRC/DFID Concordat agreement and is also part of the EDCTP2 programme supported by the European Union.

Genetic Characterization of Circulating African Swine Fever Viruses in Nigeria (2007-2015)	TRANSBOUNDARY AND EMERGING DISEASES			English	Article						African swine fever virus; Nigeria; genotyping; p72; p54; CVR; genetic variability	CENTRAL VARIABLE REGION; MOLECULAR CHARACTERIZATION; GENOME SEQUENCES; OUTBREAK; P72; EPIDEMIOLOGY; GENOTYPES; ISOLATE; RISK	Sequencing and analysis of three discrete genome regions of African swine fever viruses (ASFV) from archival samples collected in 2007-2011 and active and passive surveillance between 2012 and 2015 in Nigeria were carried out. Analysis was conducted by genotyping of three single-copy African swine fever (ASF) genes. The E183L and B646L genes that encode structural proteins p54 and p72, respectively, were utilized to delineate genotypes before intragenotypic resolution by characterization of the tetrameric amino acid repeat region within the hypervariable central variable region of the B602L gene. The results showed no variation in the p72 and p54 gene regions sequenced. Phylogeny of p72 sequences revealed that all the Nigerian isolates belonged to genotype I, while that of the p54 recovered the Ia genotype. Analysis of B602L gene revealed the differences in the number of tetrameric repeats. Four new variants (Tet-15, Tet-17a, Tet-17b and Tet-48) were recovered, while a fifth variant (Tet-20) was the most widely distributed in the country displacing Tet-36 reported previously in 2003-2006. The viruses responsible for ASF outbreaks in Nigeria are from very closely related but mutated variants of the virus that have been circulating since 1997. A practical implication of the genetic variability of the Nigerian viral isolates in this study is the need for continuous sampling and analysis of circulating viruses, which will provide epidemiological information on the evolution of ASFV in the field versus new incursion for informed strategic control of the disease in the country.

We generated a multilocus molecular phylogeny consisting of two mitochondrial (16S and ND2) and one nuclear (RAG1) gene to reconstruct relationships and examine spatiotemporal diversification patterns in the AR endemic forest chameleon, Kinyongia adolfifriderici (Sternfeld, 1912). This widely distributed species was revealed to be a complex of four genetically distinct and geographically isolated species. Three new species are described based on molecular analyses and morphological examinations. We find that K. rugegensis sp. nov. (Rugege Highlands) and K. tolleyae sp. nov. (Kigezi Highlands) form a well- supported clade, which is sister to K. gyrolepis (Lendu Plateau). Kinyongia itombwensis sp. nov. (Itombwe Plateau) was recovered as sister to K. adolfifriderici (Ituri Rainforest). The phylogeographic patterns we recovered for Kinyongia suggest that speciation stemmed from isolation in forest refugia. Our estimated diversification dates in the Miocene indicate that most species of Kinyongia diverged prior to the aridification of Africa following climate fluctuations during the Pleistocene. Our results highlight the AR as a focal point of diversification for Kinyongia, further elevating the global conservation importance of this region.

J	Liow, E; Kassam, R; Sekiwunga, R				Liow, Eric; Kassam, Rosemin; Sekiwunga, Richard			Investigating unlicensed retail drug vendors' preparedness and knowledge about malaria: An exploratory study in rural Uganda	ACTA TROPICA			English	Article						Malaria; Children; Drug shop; Private outlet; Informal; Uganda	COMMUNITY CASE-MANAGEMENT; MEDICINE SELLERS; PREVENTION; AFRICA; SECTOR; AMFM	Background: Despite major efforts to increase the uptake of preventive measures and timely use of the first line antimalarial treatment artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT), Uganda continues to fall short of meeting its national malaria control targets. One of the challenges has been scaling up effective measures in rural and remote areas where the unlicensed private retail sector remains the first point of contact and a common source of treatment. The current paper discusses unlicensed vendors' (1) training related to malaria case management for children aged five and under, and (2) knowledge related to the cause of malaria, preventive measures, common signs, and symptoms, diagnostic procedures, and best treatment options. Methods: A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews was conducted in the rural district of Butaleja, Uganda in 2011. All 88 unlicensed drug outlets enumerated in the study area were visited by six locally recruited research assistants, with one vendor from each outlet invited to participate. The transcripts were analyzed using acceptable qualitative research protocols. Results: About half of the 75 vendors interviewed had received some sort of formal training on malaria at a post-secondary institution, although only 6.7% had qualifications which met licensure requirements. The study found widespread misconceptions relating to the cause, as well as prevention and treatment of malaria. A large majority of the vendors relied primarily on non-specific symptoms and limited physical exams for diagnoses, with less than one-tenth of the vendors recognizing that rapid or microscopic blood testing was necessary to confirm a clinical diagnosis of malaria. While most recognized mosquitoes as the primary vector for malaria, over two fifths of the vendors held misconceptions about the factors that could increase the risk of malaria, and nearly a third believed that malaria could not be prevented. With respect to acute case management, three-quarters viewed as the best option a medicine other than the government's first-line antimalarial, artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT). Almost three-fifths specified quinine as their preferred option, with about one-fifth recommending quinine injection. Conclusion: Findings from this study confirm significant gaps in unlicensed vendors' knowledge related to malaria. With increased utilization of unlicensed drug outlets in rural and remote settings such as Butaleja, findings from this study strongly supports the need to implement strategies to improve the quality of care delivered at these outlet.

The PO43--P adsorption capacity increased followed by initial concentrations increasing. Maximum PO43--P adsorptions at initial 150 mg/L of PO43--P (highest load) were average of 7.67, 6.43, 5.73 and 5.41 mg/g for WDB, CCB, RHB and SDB, respectively. Pseudo second order kinetics model could best fit PO43--P adsorption, which indicated the chemisorption via precipitation was the main mechanism for PO43--P removal. The sorption process was reversible and the adsorbed PO43--P could be desorbed in both neutral (57-78%) and acidic solution environments (75 -88%) for all biochars. Meanwhile, regenerated biochar could re-adsorb up to 5.62 mg/g at the highest initial PO43--P of 150 mg/L. The present finding implied biochar could be effectively used to recover PO43--P from anaerobic digestate. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Quality and dissemination of information from a drought early warning system in Karamoja sub-region, Uganda	JOURNAL OF ARID ENVIRONMENTS			English	Article						Sub-Saharan Africa; Drought; Rainfall prediction; DEWS; Agro-pastoralists	PASTORALISTS; CLIMATE	Drought Early Warning Systems (DEWS) are instrumental in drought mitigation because they provide drought-prone communities with information on how to mitigate and cope with drought. This study assesses the quality of DEWS information in the Karamoja sub-region of Uganda. Data were collected from 173 households that accessed information from DEWS in Kotido and Nakapiripirit districts. A three way interaction model was used to determine the socio-economic factors associated with preference for information channels. It was established that land size and level of education significantly influenced preference for information channels. The study also found that information from DEWS was applicable, relevant, and understandable though not delivered in a timely manner. Slightly more than half (51%) of the respondents accessed information from Parish Chiefs. Although most respondents stated that they preferred radio (69%), it was the least used. The households also used traditional methods like observing the direction of wind and examining animal intestines to predict drought. The study concluded that information from DEWS was of good quality although it was poorly disseminated. There is need to enhance the timeliness of information dissemination if the system is to effectively enhance community preparedness to cope the effects of drought. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the low pressure technique, briquettes were produced after carbonization of groundnut shells and bagasse. The resulting bio-char was mixed with 30, 50, 70 and 90 g of cassava and wheat flour starch binder for each 1000 g of groundnut shells and bagasse bio-char. Groundnut shell briquettes were also developed under high pressure (230 MPa) using groundnut shells (1000 g) without a binder, groundnut shells (1000 g) with cassava flour starch binder (250 g) and groundnut shells with wheat flour starch binder (250 g). Thermo physical properties of the briquettes were determined using thermo-gravimetric analysis. A Bomb calorimeter was used to determine the higher heating values of the briquettes. Thermal characteristics were determined by observing the flame temperature during combustion. The mechanical integrity of the briquettes was determined using the drop test method. The higher heating values for groundnut shell and bagasse briquettes developed using low pressure techniques were between 21 and 23 MJ/kg for both cassava and wheat starch binders. The results were all above the 16 MJ/kg average recorded for non carbonized groundnut shell briquettes developed under high pressure. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Data on parasitaemia prevalence among children less than 5 years old and coverage of interventions was collected during the first two Malaria Indicator Surveys (MIS) conducted in 2009 and 2014, respectively. In this study, we quantify the effects of control interventions on parasitaemia risk changes between the two MIS in a spatio-temporal analysis. Methods: Bayesian geostatistical and temporal models were fitted on the MIS data of 2009 and 2014. The models took into account geographical misalignment in the locations of the two surveys and adjusted for climatic changes and socio-economic differentials. Parasitaemia risk was predicted over a 2 x 2 km(2) grid and the number of infected children less than 5 years old was estimated. Geostatistical variable selection was applied to identify the most important ITN coverage indicators. A spatially varying coefficient model was used to estimate intervention effects at sub-national level. Results: The coverage of Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs) and ACTs more than doubled at country and sub-national levels during the period 2009-2014. The coverage of Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) remained static at all levels. ITNs, IRS, and ACTs were associated with a reduction in parasitaemia odds of 19% (95% BCI: 18-29%), 78% (95% BCI: 67-84%), and 34% (95% BCI: 28-66%), respectively. Intervention effects varied with region. Higher socio-economic status and living in urban areas were associated with parasitaemia odds reduction of 46% (95% BCI: 0.51-0.57) and 57% (95% BCI: 0.40-0.53), respectively. The probability of parasitaemia risk decline in the country was 85% and varied from 70% in the North-East region to 100% in Kampala region. The estimated number of children infected with malaria declined from 2,480,373 in 2009 to 825,636 in 2014. Conclusions: Interventions have had a strong effect on the decline of parasitaemia risk in Uganda during 2009-2014, albeit with varying magnitude in the regions. This success should be sustained by optimizing ITN coverage to achieve universal coverage.

Chronic heart failure patients' understanding of and beliefs about their illness and its treatment: A qualitative longitudinal study from Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HEALTH; LITERACY; OUTCOMES; AFRICA	Background Patients with heart failure in Uganda present for health care with advanced structural heart disease, have repeated hospitalizations and poorly controlled disease symptoms. The reasons for these are unclear. Literature from other settings shows that patients' understanding of their illness and their beliefs influence their health related behaviour. The study aimed to explore the beliefs of patients with heart failure, their understanding of their illness and its treatment, and how this influenced their health related behaviour to inform future health education programs, information and palliative care services. Methods Serial qualitative in-depth interviews were conducted with Heart Failure patients who were purposively sampled and recruited in Mulago National Referral Hospital until thematic saturation was reached. In-depth interviews were conducted at three time points over the course of their illness with intervals of 3 months between interviews. A grounded theory approach was used in data analysis. The University of Edinburgh ethics committee, Mulago Hospital Research Ethics committee and the Uganda National Council of Science and Technology (Reference numbers D/GC/178; MREC 33, SS 3083 respectively) approved the research. Results A total of 40 face to face qualitative longitudinal interviews (36-patient alone, 4 paired-patient and family carer), were conducted with 21 patients. The findings revealed that heart failure patients were unaware of the symptoms of the illness and their definition of illness differed from that of health professionals. Patients understood their diagnosis, cause of illness, prognosis and the importance of the medicines differently from health professionals, and had insufficient information on self-care. Lay beliefs were used to explain many aspects of the illness and treatments. All these influenced where patients sought care and their adherence to treatment, self-care and follow up leading to uncontrolled disease. Conclusion There is a high level of health illiteracy among heart failure patients in Uganda. Patients rely on lay beliefs to make health decisions and medical information is often miscomprehended. There is an urgent need for health education using culturally appropriate information.

In addition, PPH is a leading cause of maternal mortality in Asia and Africa. In the U.S.A., care of critically ill patients is often practiced using mannequin-based simulation. Mannequin-based simulation presents challenges in global health, particularly in low-or middle-income countries. We developed a novel multiplayer screen-based simulation in a virtual world enabling the practice of team coordination with PPH. We used this simulation with learners in Mulago, Uganda. We hypothesized that a multiplayer screen-based simulation experience would increase learner confidence in their ability to manage PPH. Methods: The study design was a simple pre- and a post-intervention survey. Forty-eight interprofessional subjects participated in one of nine 1-h simulation sessions using the PPH software. A fifteen-question self-assessment administered before and after the intervention was designed to probe the areas of learning as defined by Bloom and Krathwohl: affective, cognitive, and psychomotor. Results: Combined confidence scores increased significantly overall following the simulation experience and individually in each of the three categories of Bloom's Taxonomy: affective, cognitive, and psychomotor. Conclusion: We provide preliminary evidence that multiplayer screen-based simulation represents a scalable, distributable form of learning that may be used effectively in global health education and training. Interestingly, despite our intervention being screen-based, our subjects showed improved confidence in their ability to perform psychomotor tasks. Although there is precedent for mental rehearsal improving performance, further research is needed to understand this finding.

During the outbreak, area surgeons reported a surge in cases of typhoid intestinal perforation (TIP), a complication of typhoid fever. We conducted an investigation to characterize TIP cases and identify modifiable risk factors for TIP. Methods: We defined a TIP case as a physician-diagnosed typhoid patient with non-traumatic terminal ileum perforation. We identified cases by reviewing medical records at all five major hospitals in Kampala from 2013 to 2015. In a matched case-control study, we compared potential risk factors among TIP cases and controls; controls were typhoid patients diagnosed by TUBEX TF, culture, or physician but without TIP, identified from the outbreak line-list and matched to cases by age, sex and residence. Cases and controls were interviewed using a standard questionnaire from 1st - 23rd December 2015. We used conditional logistic regression to assess risk factors for TIP and control for confounding. Results: Of the 88 TIP cases identified during 2013-2015, 77% (68/88) occurred between January and June, 2015; TIPs sharply increased in January and peaked in March, coincident with the typhoid outbreak. The estimated risk of TIP was 6.6 per 1000 suspected typhoid infections (68/10,230). The case-fatality rate was 10% (7/68). Cases sought care later than controls; Compared with 29% (13/45) of TIP cases and 63% (86/137) of controls who sought treatment within 3 days of onset, 42% (19/45) of cases and 32% (44/137) of controls sought treatment 4-9 days after illness onset (ORadj = 2.2, 95% CI = 0.83-5.8), while 29% (13/45) of cases and 5.1% (7/137) of controls sought treatment >= 10 days after onset (ORadj = 11, 95% CI = 1.9-61). 68% (96/141) of cases and 23% (23/100) of controls had got treatment before being treated at the treatment centre (ORadj = 9.0, 95% CI = 1.1-78). Conclusion: Delay in seeking treatment increased the risk of TIPs. For future outbreaks, we recommended aggressive community case-finding, and informational campaigns in affected communities and among local healthcare providers to increase awareness of the need for early and appropriate treatment.

Methods: This study used a quantitative design that involved a random sample of 1339 children and adolescents with HIV and their caregivers. The Participants completed an extensive battery of measures including a standardized DSM-5 referenced rating scale, the parent version (5-18 years) of the Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory-5 (CASI-5). Using logistic regression, we estimated the prevalence of ADHD and presentations, correlates and its impact on negative clinical and behavioural factors. Results: The overall prevalence of ADHD was 6% (n = 81; 95% CI, 4.8-7.5%). The predominantly inattentive presentation was the most common (3.7%) whereas the combined presentation was the least prevalent (0.7%). Several correlates were associated with ADHD: socio-demographic (age, sex and socio-economic status); caregiver (caregiver psychological distress and marginally, caregiver educational attainment); child's psychosocial environment (quality of child-caregiver relationship, history of physical abuse and marginally, orphanhood); and HIV illness parameters (marginally, CD4 counts). ADHD was associated with poor academic performance, school disciplinary problems and early onset of sexual intercourse. Conclusions: ADHD impacts the lives of many CA-HIV and is associated with poorer academic performance and earlier onset of sexual intercourse. There is an urgent need to integrate the delivery of mental health services into routine clinical care for CA-HIV in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This potentially increases the risk of unwanted treatment outcomes. We investigated medicine use practices in management of symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections among children (<= 12 years) in households in Nakawa division, Kampala city. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted among 390 randomly selected children. Data on use of medicines in children (<= 12 years) during recent episode of acute upper respiratory tract infection was collected from their care takers using an interviewer administered questionnaire. A recall period of two weeks (14 days) was used in during data collection. Results: The prevalence of giving children non-prescription antimicrobial medicines was 44.8% (38.3-52.2). The most common disease symptoms that the children reportedly had included flu, 84.9% (331/390), cough, 83.1% (324/390), and undefined fever, 69.7% (272/390). Medicines commonly given to children included, paracetamol 53. 1% (207/390), Coartem 29.7% (116/390), cough linctus 20.8% (81/390), amoxicillin 18.9% (74/390), Co-trimoxazole 18. 5% (72/390), and diphenhydramine 15.4% (60/390). The major sources of medicines given to the children was hospital/clinic, 57.26% (223/390). Most of the children, 81% were given more than one medicine at a time. The majority, 62.3% (243/390) of the care takers who gave the children medicine during the recent illness were not aware of any medicine (s) that should not be given to children. The predictors of non-prescription use of antimicrobial medicines in managing symptoms of acute upper respiratory tract infections in children included, medicines obtained from drug shop (PR: 1.45, CI: 1.14-1.85), medicines at home (PR: 1.8, CI: 0.83-1.198) and type of medicine (antimalarial) (PR: 2.8, CI: 1.17-6.68). Conclusion: Children are commonly given multiple medicines during episodes of acute upper respiratory tract infections with most antimicrobial agents accessed and used without a prescription in Kampala city, Uganda.

Despite this potential, there is a dearth of information on the increasing choice of camel production among pastoralists in the region. Camel-owning households were obtained through snowball sampling approach whereas those without camels were obtained randomly in the vicinity of those who had camels. A total of 116 respondents were interviewed in Moroto and Amudat districts of the Karamoja sub-region, Uganda. Descriptive statistics and binary probit regression analysis were conducted on the data. Results showed that 45% of the sampled households owned camels with an average camel holding of 17.96 +/- 22.12 heads. There were more cows (9.67 +/- 12.368) than bulls (3.85 +/- 7.149) in the camel herds. Only 8% and 26% of camel herders had access to extension services and financial credit respectively. The binary probit regression model revealed that age of the household head, household size, on- farm income and herd size significantly influenced the decision to undertake camel production in the region. Furthermore, all the household members were engaged in different camel management activities; however, herding was mainly the responsibility of the children (34.9%) and adult males (32.1%). Milking was mainly done by women (33.6%) while disease management was done by adult males (48.7%) and the elderly (22%) in the household. Provision of higher milk quantities (44.3%) and camels being in the lineage (13.6%) were cited as the key motivations for camel rearing. On the other hand, 56% of respondents observed that the initial high cost of camel acquisition was the main limitation to owning camels. This study has shown that decision-making in transitioning to camel production in Karamoja is a result of socio-economic attributes including pastoralists' perceptions of associated costs and benefits arising from camel production. Therefore, it is vital to strengthen innovative financing mechanisms and traditional systems such as agistments that can support pastoralists willing to acquire camels. There is need for extension services that target camel rearing where women and children are involved given their central role in camel management.

Population genomics of virulence genes of Plasmodium falciparum in clinical isolates from Uganda	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ESTIMATING SPECIES RICHNESS; PAPUA-NEW-GUINEA; ANTIGENIC VARIATION; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; MALARIA; CHILDREN; SEQUENCE; PFEMP1; FAMILY; ERYTHROCYTES	Plasmodium falciparum causes a spectrum of malarial disease from asymptomatic to uncomplicated through to severe. Investigations of parasite virulence have associated the expression of distinct variants of the major surface antigen of the blood stages known as PfEMP1 encoded by up to 60 var genes per genome. Looking at the population genomics of var genes in cases of uncomplicated malaria, we set out to determine if there was any evidence of a selective sweep of specific var genes or clonal epidemic structure related to the incidence of uncomplicated disease in children. By sequencing the conserved DBL alpha domain of var genes from six sentinel sites in Uganda we found that the parasites causing uncomplicated P. falciparum disease in children were highly diverse and that every child had a unique var DBLa repertoire. Despite extensive var DBLa diversity and minimal overlap between repertoires, specific DBLa types and groups were conserved at the population level across Uganda. This pattern was the same regardless of the geographic distance or malaria transmission intensity. These data lead us to propose that any parasite can cause uncomplicated malarial disease and that these diverse parasite repertoires are composed of both upsA and non-upsA var gene groups.

GBD 2016 Mortality Collaborators	Global, regional, and national under-5 mortality, adult mortality, age-specific mortality, and life expectancy, 1970-2016: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016	LANCET			English	Article							RUSSIAN MORTALITY; CHILD-MORTALITY; HEALTH; COUNTRIES; HIV; INCOME; INTERVENTIONS; ASSOCIATION; SANITATION; FERTILITY	Background Detailed assessments of mortality patterns, particularly age-specific mortality, represent a crucial input that enables health systems to target interventions to specific populations. Understanding how all-cause mortality has changed with respect to development status can identify exemplars for best practice. To accomplish this, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2016 (GBD 2016) estimated age-specific and sex-specific all-cause mortality between 1970 and 2016 for 195 countries and territories and at the subnational level for the five countries with a population greater than 200 million in 2016. Methods We have evaluated how well civil registration systems captured deaths using a set of demographic methods called death distribution methods for adults and from consideration of survey and census data for children younger than 5 years. We generated an overall assessment of completeness of registration of deaths by dividing registered deaths in each location-year by our estimate of all-age deaths generated from our overall estimation process. For 163 locations, including subnational units in countries with a population greater than 200 million with complete vital registration (VR) systems, our estimates were largely driven by the observed data, with corrections for small fluctuations in numbers and estimation for recent years where there were lags in data reporting (lags were variable by location, generally between 1 year and 6 years). For other locations, we took advantage of different data sources available to measure under-5 mortality rates (U5MR) using complete birth histories, summary birth histories, and incomplete VR with adjustments; we measured adult mortality rate (the probability of death in individuals aged 15-60 years) using adjusted incomplete VR, sibling histories, and household death recall. We used the U5MR and adult mortality rate, together with crude death rate due to HIV in the GBD model life table system, to estimate age-specific and sex-specific death rates for each location-year. Using various international databases, we identified fatal discontinuities, which we defined as increases in the death rate of more than one death per million, resulting from conflict and terrorism, natural disasters, major transport or technological accidents, and a subset of epidemic infectious diseases; these were added to estimates in the relevant years. In 47 countries with an identified peak adult prevalence for HIV/AIDS of more than 0.5% and where VR systems were less than 65% complete, we informed our estimates of age-sex-specific mortality using the Estimation and Projection Package (EPP)-Spectrum model fitted to national HIV/AIDS prevalence surveys and antenatal clinic serosurveillance systems. We estimated stillbirths, early neonatal, late neonatal, and childhood mortality using both survey and VR data in spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression models. We estimated abridged life tables for all location-years using age-specific death rates. We grouped locations into development quintiles based on the Sociodemographic Index (SDI) and analysed mortality trends by quintile. Using spline regression, we estimated the expected mortality rate for each age-sex group as a function of SDI. We identified countries with higher life expectancy than expected by comparing observed life expectancy to anticipated life expectancy on the basis of development status alone. Findings Completeness in the registration of deaths increased from 28% in 1970 to a peak of 45% in 2013; completeness was lower after 2013 because of lags in reporting. Total deaths in children younger than 5 years decreased from 1970 to 2016, and slower decreases occurred at ages 5-24 years. By contrast, numbers of adult deaths increased in each 5-year age bracket above the age of 25 years. The distribution of annualised rates of change in age-specific mortality rate differed over the period 2000 to 2016 compared with earlier decades: increasing annualised rates of change were less frequent, although rising annualised rates of change still occurred in some locations, particularly for adolescent and younger adult age groups. Rates of stillbirths and under-5 mortality both decreased globally from 1970. Evidence for global convergence of death rates was mixed; although the absolute difference between age-standardised death rates narrowed between countries at the lowest and highest levels of SDI, the ratio of these death rates-a measure of relative inequality-increased slightly. There was a strong shift between 1970 and 2016 toward higher life expectancy, most noticeably at higher levels of SDI. Among countries with populations greater than 1 million in 2016, life expectancy at birth was highest for women in Japan, at 86.9 years (95% UI 86.7-87.2), and for men in Singapore, at 81.3 years (78.8-83.7) in 2016. Male life expectancy was generally lower than female life expectancy between 1970 and 2016, and the gap between male and female life expectancy increased with progression to higher levels of SDI. Some countries with exceptional health performance in 1990 in terms of the difference in observed to expected life expectancy at birth had slower progress on the same measure in 2016. Interpretation Globally, mortality rates have decreased across all age groups over the past five decades, with the largest improvements occurring among children younger than 5 years. However, at the national level, considerable heterogeneity remains in terms of both level and rate of changes in age-specific mortality; increases in mortality for certain age groups occurred in some locations. We found evidence that the absolute gap between countries in age-specific death rates has declined, although the relative gap for some age-sex groups increased. Countries that now lead in terms of having higher observed life expectancy than that expected on the basis of development alone, or locations that have either increased this advantage or rapidly decreased the deficit from expected levels, could provide insight into the means to accelerate progress in nations where progress has stalled.

Paediat Second-line Study Grp	Multicentre analysis of second-line antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected children: adolescents at high risk of failure	JOURNAL OF THE INTERNATIONAL AIDS SOCIETY			English	Article						antiretroviral treatment; children; adolescents; virologic failure; HIV-1; second-line treatment	VIROLOGICAL FAILURE; TREATMENT OUTCOMES; VIRAL SUPPRESSION; THERAPY; RESISTANCE; PREDICTORS; HIV/AIDS	Introduction: The number of HIV-infected children and adolescents requiring second-line antiretroviral treatment (ART) is increasing in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC). However, the effectiveness of paediatric second-line ART and potential risk factors for virologic failure are poorly characterized. We performed an aggregate analysis of second-line ART outcomes for children and assessed the need for paediatric third-line ART. Methods: We performed a multicentre analysis by systematically reviewing the literature to identify cohorts of children and adolescents receiving second-line ART in LMIC, contacting the corresponding study groups and including patient-level data on virologic and clinical outcomes. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates and Cox proportional hazard models were used to describe cumulative rates and predictors of virologic failure. Virologic failure was defined as two consecutive viral load measurements >1000 copies/ml after at least six months of second-line treatment. Results: We included 12 cohorts representing 928 children on second-line protease inhibitor (PI)-based ART in 14 countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. After 24 months, 16.4% (95% confidence interval (CI): 13.9-19.4) of children experienced virologic failure. Adolescents (10-18 years) had failure rates of 14.5 (95% CI 11.9-17.6) per 100 person-years compared to 4.5 (95% CI 3.4-5.8) for younger children (3-9 years). Risk factors for virologic failure were adolescence (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 3.93, p < 0.001) and short duration of first-line ART before treatment switch (aHR 0.64 and 0.53, p = 0.008, for 24-48 months and >48 months, respectively, compared to < 24 months). Conclusions: In LMIC, paediatric PI-based second-line ART was associated with relatively low virologic failure rates. However, adolescents showed exceptionally poor virologic outcomes in LMIC, and optimizing their HIV care requires urgent attention. In addition, 16% of children and adolescents failed PI-based treatment and will require integrase inhibitors to construct salvage regimens. These drugs are currently not available in LMIC.

Findings are contextualized and supported by long-term data sources for tourism, protected area-based employment, tourism revenue sharing, resource access agreements, and problem animal abundance. We found decreasing perceived benefit and increasing perceived problems associated with the protected area over time, with both trends dominated by increased human-wildlife conflict due to recovering elephant numbers. Proportions of households claiming benefit from specific conservation strategies were increasing, but not enough to offset crop raiding. Ecosystem services mitigated perceptions of problems. As human and animal populations rise, wildlife authorities in Sub-Saharan Africa will be challenged to balance perceptions and adapt policies to ensure the continued existence of protected areas. Understanding the dynamic nature of local people's perceptions provides a tool to adapt protected area management plans, prioritize conservation resources, and engage local communities to support protected areas.

V delta 2+T cell response to malaria correlates with protection from infection but is attenuated with repeated exposure	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DELTA-T-CELLS; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; UP-REGULATION; IMMUNITY; LYMPHOCYTES; EXPRESSION; TOLERANCE; UGANDA; TIM-3; TRANSMISSION	V delta 2(+) gamma delta T cells are semi-innate T cells that expand markedly following P. falciparum (Pf) infection in naive adults, but are lost and become dysfunctional among children repeatedly exposed to malaria. The role of these cells in mediating clinical immunity (i.e. protection against symptoms) to malaria remains unclear. We measured V delta 2(+) T cell absolute counts at acute and convalescent malaria timepoints (n = 43), and V delta 2(+) counts, cellular phenotype, and cytokine production following in vitro stimulation at asymptomatic visits (n = 377), among children aged 6 months to 10 years living in Uganda. Increasing age was associated with diminished in vivo expansion following malaria, and lower V delta 2 absolute counts overall, among children living in a high transmission setting. Microscopic parasitemia and expression of the immunoregulatory markers Tim-3 and CD57 were associated with diminished V delta 2(+) T cell pro-inflammatory cytokine production. Higher V delta 2 pro-inflammatory cytokine production was associated with protection from subsequent Pf infection, but also with an increased odds of symptoms once infected. V delta 2(+) T cells may play a role in preventing malaria infection in children living in endemic settings; progressive loss and dysfunction of these cells may represent a disease tolerance mechanism that contributes to the development of clinical immunity to malaria.

Substantial uncertainty remains, however, in the amplitude of GRACE gravity signals and the disaggregation of TWS into individual terrestrial water stores (e.g. groundwater storage). Here, we test the phase and amplitude of three GRACE Delta TWS signals from five commonly used gridded products (i.e. NASA's GRCTellus: CSR, JPL, GFZ; JPL-Mascons; GRGS GRACE) using in situ data and modelled soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) in two sub-basins (LVB: Lake Victoria Basin; LKB: Lake Kyoga Basin) of the Upper Nile Basin. The analysis extends from January 2003 to December 2012, but focuses on a large and accurately observed reduction in Delta TWS of 83 km(3) from 2003 to 2006 in the Lake Victoria Basin. We reveal substantial variability in current GRACE products to quantify the reduction of Delta TWS in Lake Victoria that ranges from 80 km(3) (JPL-Mascons) to 69 and 31 km(3) for GRGS and GRCTellus respectively. Representation of the phase in TWS in the Upper Nile Basin by GRACE products varies but is generally robust with GRGS, JPL-Mascons, and GRCTellus (ensemble mean of CSR, JPL, and GFZ time-series data), explaining 90, 84, and 75% of the variance respectively in "in situ" or "bottom-up" Delta TWS in the LVB. Resolution of changes in groundwater storage (Delta GWS) from GRACE Delta TWS is greatly constrained by both uncertainty in changes in soil-moisture storage (Delta SMS) modelled by GLDAS LSMs (CLM, NOAH, VIC) and the low annual amplitudes in Delta GWS (e.g. 1.8-4.9 cm) observed in deeply weathered crystalline rocks underlying the Upper Nile Basin. Our study highlights the substantial uncertainty in the amplitude of Delta TWS that can result from different data-processing strategies in commonly used, gridded GRACE products; this uncertainty is disregarded in analyses of Delta TWS and individual stores applying a single GRACE product.

Efavirenz decreases etonogestrel exposure: a pharmacokinetic evaluation of implantable contraception with antiretroviral therapy	AIDS			English	Article						antiretroviral therapy; contraceptive implant; drug-drug interaction; efavirenz; etonogestrel; family planning; nevirapine	DRUG-INTERACTIONS; PLASMA PHARMACOKINETICS; IMPLANON(R) FAILURE; HIV; NEVIRAPINE; WOMEN; 3-KETO-DESOGESTREL; COUNTRIES; TRENDS; RATES	Objectives: The primary objective of this study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of etonogestrel (ENG) released from a contraceptive implant in Ugandan women living with HIV who were receiving efavirenz (EFV) or nevirapine (NVP)-based antiretroviral therapy (ART), compared with ART-naive women over 24 weeks. Design: Nonrandomized, parallel-group study with three arms: ART-naive, NVP, or EFV-based ART (N = 20/group). Methods: Sparse pharmacokinetic sampling of ENG, NVP, or EFV were performed at screening, entry, and then 1, 4, 12, and 24-week postimplant insertion. The primary endpoint was ENG concentrations at week 24, compared between the ART-naive group and each ART group, using geometric mean ratio (GMR) with 90% confidence intervals. Results: Sixty participants competed the 24-week study and data from 58 participants are included; one participant each was excluded from the NVP group and EFV group because of a sample processing error and ART nonadherence, respectively. At week 24, geometric mean ENG was 362, 341, and 66 pg/ml in the ART-naive, NVP, and EFV groups, respectively [GMR: NVP: ART-naive 0.94 (0.90-1.01); EFV : ART-naive 0.18 (0.17-0.20)]. NVP and EFV concentrations were lower at week 24 compared to preimplant [NVP: geometric mean 5.7 versus 6.8 mg/l, respectively, GMR 0.84 (0.83-0.85); EFV: geometric mean 3.6 versus 4.9 mg/l, respectively, GMR 0.73 (0.69-0.80)]. Conclusion: After 24 weeks of combined use, ENG exposure was 82% lower in women using EFV-based ART compared with ART-naive women. In contrast, NVP did not significantly impact ENG exposure. These results raise concerns about reduced effectiveness of implantable contraception for women taking EFV-based ART. Copyright (C) 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

The Uganda National Expanded Program on Immunization strives to have a sensitive surveillance system within the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) framework. We analyzed measles surveillance data to determine the effectiveness of the measles case-based surveillance system and estimate its positive predictive value in order to inform policy and practice. Methods An IDSR alert was defined as >= 1 suspected measles case reported by a district in a week, through the electronic Health Management Information System. We defined an alert in the measles case-based surveillance system (CBS) as >= 1 suspected measles case with a blood sample collected for confirmation during the corresponding week in a particular district. Effectiveness of CBS was defined as having >= 80% of IDSR alerts with a blood sample collected for laboratory confirmation. Positive predictive value was defined as the proportion of measles case-patients who also had a positive measles serological result (IgM +). We reviewed case-based surveillance data with laboratory confirmation and measles surveillance data from the electronic Health Management Information System from 2012-2015. Results A total of 6,974 suspected measles case-persons were investigated by the measles case-based surveillance between 2012 and 2015. Of these, 943 (14%) were measles specific IgM positive. The median age of measles case-persons between 2013 and 2015 was 4.0 years. Between 2013 and 2015, 72% of the IDSR alerts reported in the electronic Health Management Information System, had blood samples collected for laboratory confirmation. This was however less than the WHO recommended standard of >= 80%. The PPV of CBS between 2013 and 2015 was 8.6%. Conclusion In conclusion, the effectiveness of measles case-based surveillance was sub-optimal, while the PPV showed that true measles cases have significantly reduced in Uganda.

Metabolic complications in malaria are recognized contributors to severe and fatal malaria, but the impact of malaria infection on the production of small lipid derived signalling molecules is unknown. Knowledge of immunoregulatory patterns of these molecules in malaria is of great value for better understanding of the disease and improvement of treatment regimes, since the action of these classes of molecules is directly connected to the inflammatory response of the organism. Methods: Detection of oxylipins and endocannabinoids from plasma samples from forty children with uncomplicated and severe malaria as well as twenty controls was done after solid phase extraction followed by chromatography mass spectrometry analysis. The stable isotope dilution method was used for compound quantification. Data analysis was done with multivariate (principal component analysis (PCA), orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA (R)) and univariate approaches (receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, t tests, correlation analysis). Results: Forty different oxylipin and thirteen endocannabinoid metabolites were detected in the studied samples, with one oxylipin (thromboxane B2, TXB2) in significantly lower levels and four endocannabinoids (OEA, PEA, DEA and EPEA) at significantly higher levels in infected individuals as compared to controls according to t test analysis with Bonferroni correction. Three oxylipins (13-HODE, 9-HODE and 13-oxo-ODE) were higher in severe compared to uncomplicated malaria cases according to the results from multivariate analysis. Observed changes in oxylipin levels can be connected to activation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) and 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) metabolic pathways in malaria infected individuals compared to controls, and related to increased levels of all linoleic acid oxylipins in severe patients compared to uncomplicated ones. The endocannabinoids were extremely responsive to malaria infection with majority of this class of molecules found at higher levels in infected individuals compared to controls. Conclusions: It was possible to detect oxylipin and endocannabinoid molecules that can be potential biomarkers for differentiation between malaria infected individuals and controls and between different classes of malaria. Metabolic pathways that could be targeted towards an adjunctive therapy in the treatment of malaria were also pinpointed.

It was a retrospective cross-sectional study that involved reviewing of 739 poisoning patient records from 5 hospitals in Kampala. Of the 739 patients, 212 were due to pesticide poisoning resulting in a prevalence of 28.8%. About 91.4% (191/210) of the cases were due to organophosphate poisoning, 63.3% (133/210) were intentional, and 98.1% (206/210) were exposed through ingestion. Diagnosis was majorly based on poisoning history 91.2% (187/205), and clinical features such as airways, breathing, and circulation examination 48.0% (95/198); nausea and vomiting 42.9% (91/212); muscle weakness 29.7% (63/212); excessive salivation 23.1% (49/212); and confusion 20.3% (43/212). More than half of the patients admitted were treated using atropine 52.3% (113/212). The prevalence of acute pesticide poisoning was high with most managed based on physical and clinical examination.

Affected women suffer physically, psychologically and socioeconomically. International efforts have increased access to surgical treatment, yet attention to a holistic outcome of post-surgical rehabilitation is nascent. We sought to develop and pilot test a measurement instrument to assess post-surgical family and community reintegration. Methods: We conducted an exploratory sequential mixed-methods study, beginning with 16 in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions with 17 women who underwent fistula surgery within two previous years to inform measure development. The draft instrument was validated in a longitudinal cohort of 60 women recovering from fistula surgery. Qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis. Socio-demographic characteristics were described using one-way frequency tables. We used exploratory factor analysis to determine the latent structure of the scale, then tested the fit of a single higher-order latent factor. We evaluated internal consistency and temporal stability reliability through Raykov's. and Pearson's correlation coefficient, respectively. We estimated a series of linear regression models to explore associations between the standardized reintegration measure and validated scales representing theoretically related constructs. Results: Themes central to women's experiences following surgery included resuming mobility, increasing social interaction, improved self-esteem, reduction of internalized stigma, resuming work, meeting their own needs and the needs of dependents, meeting other expected and desired roles, and negotiating larger life issues. We expanded the Return to Normal Living Index to reflect these themes. Exploratory factor analysis suggested a four-factor structure, titled 'Mobility and social engagement', 'Meeting family needs', 'Comfort with relationships', and 'General life satisfaction', and goodness of fit statistics supported a higher-order latent variable of ` Reintegration.' Reintegration score correlated significantly with quality of life, depression, self-esteem, stigma, and social support in theoretically expected directions. Conclusion: As more women undergo surgical treatment for obstetric fistula, attention to the post-repair period is imperative. This preliminary validation of a reintegration instrument represents a first step toward improving measurement of post-surgical reintegration and has important implications for the evidence base of post-surgical reintegration epidemiology and the development and evaluation of fistula programming.

Instead, estimation of cancer survival often uses clinical records, which have some mortality data but are replete with patients who are lost to follow-up (LTFU), some of which may be caused by undocumented death. The end result is that accurate estimation of cancer survival is rarely performed. A prominent example of a common cancer in Africa for which survival data are needed but for which frequent LTFU has precluded accurate estimation is Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Methods: Using electronic records, we identified all newly diagnosed KS among HIV-infected adults at 33 primary care clinics in Kenya, Uganda, Nigeria, and Malawi from 2009 to 2012. We determined those patients who were apparently LTFU, defined as absent from clinic for >= 90 days at database closure and unknown to be dead or transferred. Using standardized protocols which included manual chart review, telephone calls, and physical tracking in the community, we attempted to update vital status amongst patients who were LTFU. Results: We identified 1222 patients with KS, of whom 440 were LTFU according to electronic records. Manual chart review revealed that 18 (4.1%) were classified as LFTU due to clerical error, leaving 422 as truly LTFU. Of these 422, we updated vital status in 78%; manual chart review was responsible for updating in 5.7%, telephone calls in 26%, and physical tracking in 46%. Among 378 patients who consented at clinic enrollment to be tracked if they became LTFU and who had sufficient geographic contact/locator information, we updated vital status in 88%. Duration of LTFU was not associated with success of tracking, but tracking success was better in Kenya than the other sites. Conclusion: It is feasible to update vital status in a large fraction of patients with HIV-associated KS in sub-Saharan Africa who have become LTFU from clinical care. This finding likely applies to other cancers as well. Updating vital status amongst lost patients paves the way towards accurate determination of cancer survival.

Despite decades of remarkable efforts made by governmental and non-governmental organization, the resilience capacity of pastoralists in Ethiopia remains poor. The aim of this study is to test the statistical relationships among the resilience dimensions that emerged through community consultations, and to identify the intervention pathways for effective resilience building efforts. Data were collected from 1058 randomly sampled households in Arero and Dhas districts of Borana Zone, Southern Ethiopia. The data were collected through interviewer administered structured questionnaire and observational checklist. Principal component analyses were done to develop composite scores of the different resilience dimensions. Structural equation model (SEM) verified the theoretical model. The SEM also revealed that resilience towards impact of recurrent droughts was multi-dimensional and showed statistically significant (p < 0.05) relationships. Consequently, household food insecurity manifested as ultimate outcome of poor resilience. Infrastructure and social services (beta = -0.24), livestock dimension (beta = -0.21), human capital (beta = -0.12), psychosocial distress (beta= -0.1) dimensions significantly (p < 0.05) affected the status of household food insecurity. Furthermore, livestock and wealth (beta = 0.16), wealth and infrastructure (beta = 0.06), infrastructure and human capital (beta = 0.18), livestock and psychosocial distress (beta = -0.09)dimensions have structural relationships and significantly influence each other. Environment, and peace and security are found to be major underlying resilience factors and significantly associated with pastoralists' resilience which affect other resilience dimensions. The intervention pathway indicated that intervention on the livestock and infrastructure dimensions could help to improve the resilience of these communities.

The mechanisms involved in trypanosoma-induced anaemia, including the role of the bone marrow haematopoietic cells are incompletely understood. We studied the responses of a tetrapeptide, AcSDKP, and IL-10, and their association with bone marrow nucleated cells in a Trypanosoma brucei brucei GVR35 experimental infection model. Methods Mouse infection was done intraperitoneally with 1 x 10(3) trypanosomes/mL. Mice were either infected or left uninfected (N = 100). At days 0, 9, 16, 23, 30, 37, and 44 post-infection, mice were euthanised and blood was collected by cardiac puncture to examine for parasitaemia and packed cell volume (PCV) and then centrifuged for plasma, which was used for cytokine ELISA. The mice's femurs were also dissected and bone marrow was collected for femur cellularity. Results PCV dropped from 39.6% to 27% in infected animals by day 9 and remained low (relative to uninfected mice) for the duration of the experiment. AcSDKP levels decreased from day 0 (11.5 x 10(4) pg/mL) to day 16 (10 x 10(4)), and increased by day 30 (12.6 x 10(4)). There was a significant difference at day 16 (P = 0.023) between the infected and uninfected groups. By contrast, expression of IL-10 markedly increased between day 0 (18.6 pg/mL) and day 16 (145 pg/mL) and decreased by day 30 (42.8 pg/mL). There was also a significant difference in IL-10 expression between infected and uninfected mice at day 16 (P < 0.001). Bone marrow nucleated cells were significantly reduced during periods of low plasma AcSDKP and high plasma IL-10 concentrations (5.4 x 10(6) infected vs 6.2 x 106 on day 0 and 4.9 x 10(6) infected vs 10 x 10(6) uninfected on day 16). Conclusions These data unravel a possible negative feedback interaction between AcSDKP and IL-10 in trypanosome infection. More importantly, this study implicates an IL-10/AcSDKP cytokine network in the regulation of bone marrow nucleated cells and provides a new potential mechanism in the pathogenesis of trypanosoma-induced anaemia. Further mechanistic blocking experiments on AcSDKP and IL-10 are recommended to further clarify understanding of the interaction.

Antimicrobial Resistance of Sterile Site Infections in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Review						antibacterial agents; antimicrobial resistance; microbial susceptibility tests; review; sub-Saharan Africa	DRUG-RESISTANCE; CHILDREN	Sparse data exist from sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) on the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). A prior review of antimicrobial resistance in SSA from 1990 to 2013 showed a high prevalence of AMR to commonly used antibiotics in this setting. We reviewed the literature published since 2013. Four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and African Journals Online) were searched for articles between February 2013 and March 2016 with a focus on sterile site infections (bacteremia, urinary tract infections [UTIs], and meningitis). We focused on the original World Health Organization-identified priority pathogens and antibiotics, prior to the release of the most recently updated and expanded list in 2017. There were 19 eligible studies: bacteremia (12), UTI (6), and meningitis (1). Eight studies were from Western and Central Africa, 8 from Eastern Africa, and 4 from Southern Africa. Prevalence of Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins ranged from 0% to 75%. No studies reported resistance to carbapenems among Klebsiella spp. Prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance ranged from 8.3% to 100% among E. coli and 0% to 15% among Salmonella spp. Prevalence of resistance to penicillin among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates ranged from 25% to 100%. Testing for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was reported in 7 studies (range, 1.3-60% among tested isolates). Methods for evaluating AMR varied across studies; standardized approaches are needed in the region. Testing for mechanisms of resistance is low even in research settings, but important mechanisms of resistance such as ESBL production are present.

Despite its importance, relatively few measurements of the VSF have been carried out in aquatic environments, and we present here data and analyses of measured VSFs at 442, 490, and 550 nm for 15 representative phytoplankton species from Norwegian coastal waters. In addition, the analytic scattering phase functions Henyey-Greenstein (HG) and Fournier-Forand, as well as Mie theory, were fitted and compared to the measured VSFs. The measured VSFs for all the species were strongly, but unequally forward peaked with HG-fitted asymmetry factors in the range 0.897-0.988. The VSF of Synechococcus sp., Phaeodactylum tricornutum, and Emiliania huxleyi (naked) had shoulders in the forward direction, whereas the VSF of the cylindrically shaped Chaetoceros calcitrans and Chaetoceros wighamii had minima in the backward direction. Results from this work indicate that internal structures influence the angular and spectral shape of the VSF more significantly than the morphology and size of the phytoplankton cells.

J	Odoi, N				Odoi, Nora			The information behaviour of Ugandan banana farmers in the context of participatory development communication	INFORMATION RESEARCH-AN INTERNATIONAL ELECTRONIC JOURNAL			English	Article							NEEDS	Introduction. The study investigated famers' information behaviour during participatory development communication with researchers, in a farming context. It uses farmers' verbatim accounts during their search for information from researchers. Method. The study employed social survey research design which used focus group discussions, questionnaires and farm observations to collect data. A total of 120 small-scale farmers participated in the study. Analysis. Analysis of qualitative data was continuous. It occurred even during the planning stages aimed at establishing patterns, trends and relationships. Tentative themes and data categories were identified and assigned numerical codes representing attributes. Collected data were grouped according to the codes, and quantitatively analysed to reveal frequency of occurency. Quantitative data were processed and analysed using the SPSS, and Epi-data computer programs. Results. Most farmers obtained communally-expected information, but did not have personal expectations satisfied by the initiatives. They also obtained unanticipated benefits. Farmers used the acquired information despite challenges encountered. This led to improvement in banana yields. Conclusion. Participatory development communication helped researchers to disseminate information to farmers who, in turn, acquired and used the information for a relatively long time. Information intermediaries should study participatory development communication further, to adapt it for future information dissemination activities.

Diversity and abundance of twig borers of Robusta coffee and their associated ambrosia fungi in Uganda	AFRICAN ENTOMOLOGY			English	Article						Coffea canephora; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Fusarium solani; Glomerella cingulata; Scolytinae; Xylosandrus compactus	XYLOSANDRUS-COMPACTUS; BEETLE; COLEOPTERA; SCOLYTINAE	Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora) is of great economic importance to Uganda. However, its production is recently impeded by the ambrosia twig borer Xylosandrus compactus. A survey was conducted in 10 randomly selected districts in the main Robusta coffee-growing regions of mid-eastern, central and mid-western Uganda to determine (1) diversity, incidence and abundance of twig borers attacking C. canephora in Uganda and (2) ambrosia fungi associated with these twig borers. In each district, 10 randomly selected farms were inspected for twig borer species attacks. Up to 20 twigs infested by twig borers per farm were sampled and dissected to morphologically identify borer species inside the twigs and enumerate different stages of the borers per twig. Ambrosia fungi from galleries of each distinct twig borer were isolated and identified using molecular techniques. Five twig borer species, X. compactus, Xylosandrus sp., Hypothenemus sp. and two unidentified twig borers (K1 and K2), were found attacking C. canephora. Whereas the rest of these species were detected in only single coffee twigs from single farms, X. compactus occurred in nine of the 10 study districts. The proportion of X. compactus-infested farms in each of these districts ranged from 0.1 to 1 and the number of X. compactus individuals per twig per district ranged from 2.5 +/- 1.9 to 29 +/- 28.1. Fusarium solani was isolated from galleries of both X. compactus and K1, whereas Glomerella cingulata was isolated from a gallery of K2.	[Egonyu, J.

High Postdischarge Morbidity in Ugandan Children With Severe Malarial Anemia or Cerebral Malaria	JOURNAL OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASES SOCIETY			English	Article						cerebral malaria; incidence; readmission; severe malarial anemia	PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; PLACEBO-CONTROLLED TRIAL; WESTERN KENYA; MORTALITY; TRANSFUSION; MULTICENTER; IMPAIRMENT; SEQUELAE	Background. Cerebral malaria (CM) and severe malarial anemia (SMA) account for a substantial proportion of malaria-related deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. However, postdischarge morbidity in children with CM or SMA has not been well established. Methods. Children 18 months to 12 years of age, enrolled on admission to Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala, Uganda (CM, n = 162; SMA, n = 138), and healthy children recruited from the community (CC) (n = 133) were followed up for 6 months. The incidences of hospitalizations and outpatient clinic visits for illness during the follow-up period were compared between children with CM or SMA and the CC. Results. After adjustment for age, sex, and nutritional status, children with SMA had a higher incidence rate ratio (IRR) than CC for hospitalization (95% confidence interval [CI], 20.81 [2.48-174.68]), hospitalization with malaria (17.29 [95% CI, 2.02-148.35]), and clinic visits for any illness (95% CI, 2.35 [1.22-4.51]). Adjusted IRRs for children with CM were also increased for all measures compared with those for CC, but they achieved statistical significance only for clinic visits for any illness (2.24 [95% CI, 1.20-4.15]). In both groups, the primary reason for the clinic visits and hospitalizations was malaria. Conclusions. In the 6 months after initial hospitalization, children with SMA have an increased risk of repeated hospitalization, and children with CM or SMA have an increased risk of outpatient illness. Malaria is the main cause of inpatient and outpatient morbidity. Malaria prophylaxis has the potential to decrease postdischarge morbidity rates in children with SMA or CM.]	[Opoka, Robert O.; Idro, Richard] Makerere Univ, Dept Paediat, Kampala, Uganda; [Bangirana, Paul] Makerere Univ, Dept Psychiat, Kampala, Uganda; [Hamre, Karen E.

Study design This is a cross-sectional study that used data from the Rakai Community Cohort Study (RCCS) database between 2013 and 2014. A structured questionnaire was used for data collection. We used stepwise logistic regression as an index to estimate the adjusted ORs for the association between risky sexual behaviours and ART treatment status. Study setting This study was conducted in Rakai district, located in south-western Uganda. The data for this study were extracted from the RCCS. RCCS is an open prospective cohort of approximately 15 000 consenting participants aged 15-49 years. Participants HIV-positive participants aged 18-49 years who had sex at least once a month with any partner prior to the start of the study. Main outcome measures Inconsistent/no condom use in the last 12 months, alcohol use at last sexual encounter, and two or more sexual partners. Results ART-naive participants were more likely to report inconsistent condom use (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73) and more likely to drink alcohol at last sexual encounter (OR=1.65, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.46), compared with ART-experienced patients. ART treatment status (p< 0.001) was a significant predictor of risky sexual behaviours. Both marital status (p=0.016) and occupation level (p=0.009) were positively associated with inconsistent condom use, while sex (p< 0.001) correlated with alcohol use at last sexual encounter. Conclusion ART-naive participants were more likely to exhibit risky sexual behaviours than the ART-experienced participants. The intensity of risk reduction counselling should be increased for HIV-positive persons waiting to start ART but already in HIV care.

Several factors influence the efficacy of TB treatment by leading to suboptimal drug concentrations and subsequently affecting treatment outcome. The aim of this cohort is to determine the association between anti-TB drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes. Participants Patients diagnosed with new pulmonary TB at the integrated TB-HIV outpatient clinic in Kampala, Uganda, were enrolled into the study and started on first-line anti-TB treatment. Findings to date Between April 2013 and April 2015, the cohort enrolled 268 patients coinfected with TB/HIV; 57.8% are male with a median age of 34 years (IQR 29-40). The median time between the diagnosis of HIV and the diagnosis of TB is 2 months (IQR 0-22.5). The majority of the patients are antiretroviral therapy naive (75.4%). Our population is severely immunosuppressed with a median CD4 cell count at enrolment of 163 cells/mu L (IQR 46-298). Ninety-nine per cent of the patients had a diagnosis of pulmonary TB confirmed by sputum microscopy, Xpert/RIF or culture and 203 (75.7%) have completed TB treatment with 5099 aliquots of blood collected for pharmacokinetic analysis. Future plans This cohort provides a large database of well-characterised patients coinfected with TB/HIV which will facilitate the description of the association between serum drug concentrations and TB treatment outcomes as well as provide a research platform for future substudies including evaluation of virological outcomes.

The objective of the study was to evaluate the mineral composition of T. indica pulp and seed samples from across Uganda's different agro-ecological zones and land use types. Separately grounded samples of T. indica pulp and seeds were analyzed for Zn, Fe, Mg, P, Na, K, and Ca. The univariate analysis of variance in the General Linear Model was used to compare differences in mineral composition. Treatment means were separated using Least Significant Difference (LSD) in Post Hoc Tests. The results showed that there were significant differences (p <= 0.005) in mineral composition levels of T. indica pulp and seed samples between the different agro-ecological zones with the exception of P and Na (for pulp). The T.indica pulp and seeds samples from the Lake Victoria Crescent zone and wild land use type had generally higher mineral levels than T. indica samples from other agro-ecological zones and different land use types. As mineral composition levels were generally higher in the seed than the pulp samples, consumption of T. indica seeds should be promoted. There is also need to conserve individual species both on-farm and in the wild population, but T. indica mineral concentrations (both pulp and seeds) were higher in the samples from the wild population, making them good for human and animal diets.

Peoples' knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg virus disease impact on control and prevention measures especially during outbreaks. We describe knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg virus outbreaks in two affected communities in Uganda to inform future outbreak responses and help in the design of health education and communication messages. Methods The study was a community survey done in Luweero, Ibanda and Kamwenge districts that have experienced outbreaks of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases. Quantitative data were collected using a structured questionnaire and triangulated with qualitative participatory epidemiology techniques to gain a communities' knowledge and attitude towards Ebola and Marburg virus disease. Results Out of 740 respondents, 48.5% (359/740) were categorized as being knowledgeable about Ebola and Marburg virus diseases, whereas 60.5% (448/740) were having a positive attitude towards control and prevention of Ebola and Marburg virus diseases. The mean knowledge and attitude percentage scores were 54.3 (SD = 23.5, 95% CI = 52.6-56.0) and 69.9 (SD = 16.9, 95% CI = 68.9-71.1) respectively. People educated beyond primary school were more likely to be knowledgeable about Ebola and Marburg virus disease than those who did not attain any formal education (OR = 3.6, 95% CI = 2.1-6.1). Qualitative data revealed that communities describe Ebola and Marburg virus diseases as very severe diseases with no cure and they believe the diseases spread so fast. Respondents reported fear and stigma suffered by survivors, their families and the broader community due to these diseases. Conclusion Communities in Uganda affected by filovirus outbreaks have moderate knowledge about these diseases and have a positive attitude towards practices to prevent and control Ebola and Marburg viral diseases. The public health sector should enhance this community knowledge gap to empower them more by supplying educational materials for epidemic preparedness in future using appropriate communication channels as proposed by the communities.

Structural basis for the high specificity of a Trypanosoma congolense immunoassay targeting glycosomal aldolase	PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES			English	Article							DIAGNOSTIC-TEST; MODEL; ANTIGENS; ELISA; TETRAMER; SYSTEM; SERUM	Background Animal African trypanosomosis (AAT) is a neglected tropical disease which imposes a heavy burden on the livestock industry in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its causative agents are Trypanosoma parasites, with T. congolense and T. vivax being responsible for the majority of the cases. Recently, we identified a Nanobody (Nb474) that was employed to develop a homologous sandwich ELISA targeting T. congolense fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (TcoALD). Despite the high sequence identity between trypanosomatid aldolases, the Nb474-based immunoassay is highly specific for T. congolense detection. The results presented in this paper yield insights into the molecular principles underlying the assay's high specificity. Methodology/Principal findings The structure of the Nb474-TcoALD complex was determined via X-ray crystallography. Together with analytical gel filtration, the structure reveals that a single TcoALD tetramer contains four binding sites for Nb474. Through a comparison with the crystal structures of two other trypanosomatid aldolases, TcoALD residues Ala77 and Leu106 were identified as hot spots for specificity. Via ELISA and surface plasmon resonance (SPR), we demonstrate that mutation of these residues does not abolish TcoALD recognition by Nb474, but does lead to a lack of detection in the Nb474-based homologous sandwich immunoassay. Conclusions/Significance The results show that the high specificity of the Nb474-based immunoassay is not determined by the initial recognition event between Nb474 and TcoALD, but rather by its homologous sandwich design. This (i) provides insights into the optimal set-up of the assay, (ii) may be of great significance for field applications as it could explain the potential detection escape of certain T. congolense strains, and (iii) may be of general interest to those developing similar assays.

The development of genomic resources can be of great use to those interested in studying and controlling the spread of these trypanosomes. Here we present a large comparative analysis of Trypanozoon whole genomes, 83 in total, including human and animal infective African trypanosomes: 21 T.brucei brucei, 22 T.b. gambiense, 35 T.b. rhodesiense and 4 T.evansi strains, of which 21 were from Uganda. We constructed a maximum likelihood phylogeny based on 162,210 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs.) The three Trypanosoma brucei sub-species and Trypanosoma evansi are not monophyletic, confirming earlier studies that indicated high similarity among Trypanosoma "sub-species". We also used discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) on the same set of SNPs, identifying seven genetic clusters. These clusters do not correspond well with existing taxonomic classifications, in agreement with the phylogenetic analysis. Geographic origin is reflected in both the phylogeny and clustering analysis. Finally, we used sparse linear discriminant analysis to rank SNPs by their informativeness in differentiating the strains in our data set. As few as 84 SNPs can completely distinguish the strains used in our study, and discriminant analysis was still able to detect genetic structure using as few as 10 SNPs. Our results reinforce earlier results of high genetic similarity between the African Trypanozoon. Despite this, a small subset of SNPs can be used to identify genetic markers that can be used for strain identification or other epidemiological investigations.

Successful commercialization of waste-based organic fertilizer businesses however largely depends on a sound market. We used a choice experiment to estimate farmers' willingness-to-pay (WTP) for faecal sludge and municipal solid waste-based (FSM) compost in Kampala, Uganda and considered three attributesfortification, pelletization and certification. Our results reveal that farmers are willing to pay for FSM compost and place a higher value on a certified' compost product. They are willing to pay US $0.4 per kg above the current market price for a similar certified product, which is 67 times higher than the cost of providing the attribute. Farmers are willing to pay US $0.127 per kg for pelletized' FSM compost, which is lower (0.57 times) than the cost of providing the attribute. On the other hand, farmers require US $0.089 per kg as a compensation to use fortified' FSM compost. We suggest that future FSM compost businesses focus on a certified and pelletized' FSM product as this product type has the highest production cost-WTP differential and for which future businesses can capture the highest percentage of the consumer surplus. The demand for FSM compost indicates the benefits that can accrue to farmers, businesses and the environment from the recycling of organic waste for agriculture.

The example of the oil companies in Angola	SCIENCES SOCIALES ET SANTE			French	Article								The civil war that tore apart Angola during more than thirty years stopped in 2002. Infrastructure and health and education systems need to be rebuilt. Needs are huge, especially in the provinces. Nevertheless, the international development NGO for which Angola could have been a juicy market are absent from the country. The oil companies, through their corporate social responsibility departments, implement or finance numerous development projects. The arrival of these new actors has different consequences on the model of development that is proposed. We will focus on the example of public health and observe how these new actors influence the public health model that is implemented in Angola.

Evaluation of Performance of Introduced Yam Bean (Pachyrhizus spp.) in Three Agro-Ecological Zones of Rwanda	TROPICAL PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Pachyrizhus; GxE; High storage roots yield; Harvest index; GGE bi-plot; Rwanda	X ENVIRONMENT INTERACTION; STABILITY ANALYSIS; YIELD; ROOT; MARKERS	The yam bean (Pachyrizhus spp) was recently introduced as a root crop with high-yield potential, considerable protein and micro-nutrient concentration to investigate its potential for food production in Rwanda. Except for Chuin types (Pachyrizhus tuberosus) which have high storage root dry matter (RDM) (26 to 36%), most accessions are consumed raw and are reported to have low RDM. The present study aimed to evaluate and identify adapted high yielding yam bean accessions in major agro-ecological zones of Rwanda. Field experiments with 22 accessions were conducted in 2012 at three research sites representing the major agro-ecologies of Rwanda. Strict reproductive pruning was followed to enhance fresh storage root yields. Across locations, ANOVA indicated highly significant differences (p < 0.01) for genotypes (G), locations (L), seasons (S) and G x L effects for storage root yield, vine yield and harvest index and accounted for 21.88%, 43.41%, 1.43% and 13.25% of the treatment sum of squares, respectively. The GGE bi-plot revealed that EC209018 is high yielding but unstable. However, genotypes, AC209034, AC209035 and EC209046, were outstanding in terms of adaptation and relative stability across the 3 locations, suggesting consistent root yields irrespective of location and environmental conditions. The GGE scatter plot showed that all genotypes formed one mega-environment for storage root yield (Karama, Musanze and Rubona) and two mega-environments for biomass yield (Karama and Rubona as one mega-environment and Musanze the second one). This study revealed that Karama is the most suitable environment for evaluation and selection of yam bean for yield components in Rwanda.

However, existing evidence suggests that rumen liquor from slaughtered cattle of unknown dietary history also generates quantifiable in vitro GP data. Fitting and description of GP data obtained from 4 diets incubated with rumen liquor from slaughtered cattle was evaluated using single-pool exponential model with discrete lag time (EXPL), logistic (LOG), Groot's (GRTS) and Gompertz (GOMP) models. Diets were formulated by varying proportions of Rhodes grass (Chloris gayana) hay and a concentrate mixed on dry matter basis to be: 1,000 g/kg Rhodes grass hay (RGH) and 0 of the concentrate (D1), 900 g/kg RGH and 100 g/kg concentrate (D2), 800 g/kg RGH and 200 g/kg concentrate (D3), 700 g/kg RGH and 300 g/kg concentrate (D4). Dietary kinetics for the models were determined by measuring GP at 2, 4, 8,10,18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 h. Model comparison was based on derived GP kinetics, graphical analysis of observed versus predicted GP profiles plus residual distribution and goodness-of-fit from analysis of root mean square error (RMSE), adjusted coefficient of determination (Adj-R-2) and Akaike's information criterion (AIC). Asymptotic GP, half-life and fractional rate of GP differed (P < 0.001) among the 4 models. The RMSE, Adj-R-2 and AIC ranged from 1.555 to 4.429, 0.906 to 0.984 and 2.452 to 15.874, respectively, for all diets compared across the 4 models. Based on the goodness-of-fit statistical criterion, GP profiles of D1 were more appropriately fitted and described by GRTS and GOMP than the EXPL and LOG models. The GRTS model had the lowest AIC value for D2 (2.452). Although GRTS model had the most homogenous residual dispersion for the 4 diets, all the 4 models exhibited a sigmoidal behavior. Therefore, rumen liquor from slaughtered cattle of unknown dietary history can be used to derive nutritionally important feed parameters, but choice of the most appropriate model should be made based on fitting criteria and dietary substrates incubated.

To that end, we asked focus groups of caretakers to list their five greatest challenges to seeking care on behalf of children under five. Using qualitative content analysis, we grouped responses according to four categories: (1) geographical access barriers; (2) facility supplies, staffing, and infrastructural barriers; (3) facility management and administration barriers (e.g. health worker professionalism, absenteeism and customer care); and (4) household barriers related to financial circumstances, domestic conflicts with male partners and a stated lack of knowledge about health-related issues. Among all focus groups, caretakers mentioned supplies, staffing and infrastructure barriers most often and facility management and administration barriers the least. Caretakers living furthest from public facilities (8-10 km) more commonly mentioned geographical barriers to care and barriers related to financial and other personal circumstances. Caretakers who lived closest to health facilities mentioned facility management and administration barriers twice as often as those who lived further away. While targeting managerial barriers is vitally important-and increasingly popular among national planners and donors-it should be done while recognizing that alleviating such barriers may have a more muted effect on caretakers who are geographically harder to reach - and by extension, those whose children have an increased risk of mortality. In light of calls for greater equity in child survival programming -and given the limited resource envelopes that policymakers often have at their disposal -attention to the barriers considered most vital among caretakers in different settings should be weighed.

Lp(a) is composed of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and apo(a) and restricted to Catarrhini. A variable number of kringle IV (KIV) domains in LPA lead to a size polymorphism of apo(a) that is inversely correlated with Lp(a) concentrations. Smaller apo(a) isoforms and higher Lp(a) levels in central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes [PTT]) compared to humans from Europe had been reported. We studied apo(a) isoforms and Lp(a) concentrations in 75 western (Pan troglodytes verus [PTV]) and 112 central chimpanzees, and 12 bonobos (Pan paniscus [PPA]), all wild born and living in sanctuaries in Sierra Leone, Republic of the Congo, and DR Congo, respectively, and 116 humans from Gabon. Lp(a) levels were severalfold higher in western than in central chimpanzees (181.0 +/- 6.7 mg/dl vs. 56.5 +/- 4.3 mg/dl), whereas bonobos showed intermediate levels (134.8 +/- 33.4 mg/dl). Apo(a) isoform sizes differed significantly between subspecies (means subspecies. Human Lp(a) concentrations (mean 47.9 +/- 2.8 mg/dl) were similar to those in central chimpanzees despite larger isoforms (mean 27.1 +/- 4.9 KIV). Lp(a) and LDL, apoB-100, and total cholesterol levels only correlated in PTV. This remarkable differentiation between chimpanzees from different African habitats and the trait's similarity in humans and chimpanzees from Central Africa poses the question of a possible impact of an environmental factor that has shaped the genetic architecture of LPA. Overall, studies on the cholesterol-containing particles of Lp(a) and LDL in chimpanzees should consider differentiation between subspecies.

Marburg virus survivor immune responses are Th1 skewed with limited neutralizing antibody responses	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article							EBOLA HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; T-CELL RESPONSES; NONNEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; INFECTION; ANTIGEN; ACTIVATION; CYTOKINE; DISEASE; ASSAY; EXPRESSION	Until recently, immune responses in filovirus survivors remained poorly understood. Early studies revealed IgM and IgG responses to infection with various filoviruses, but recent outbreaks have greatly expanded our understanding of filovirus immune responses. Immune responses in survivors of Ebola virus (EBOV) and Sudan virus (SUDV) infections have provided the most insight, with T cell responses as well as detailed antibody responses having been characterized. Immune responses to Marburg virus (MARV), however, remain almost entirely uncharacterized. We report that immune responses in MARV survivors share characteristics with EBOV and SUDV infections but have some distinct differences. MARV survivors developed multivariate CD4(+) T cell responses but limited CD8(+) T cell responses, more in keeping with SUDV survivors than EBOV survivors. In stark contrast to SUDV survivors, rare neutralizing antibody responses in MARV survivors diminished rapidly after the outbreak. These results warrant serious consideration for any vaccine or therapeutic that seeks to be broadly protective, as different filoviruses may require different immune responses to achieve immunity.

Developing emergency care systems and task sharing aspects of acute surgical care addresses many of these issues. This paper investigates the degree to which specialized non-physicians practicing in a dedicated Emergency Department contribute to the effective and efficient management of acute surgical patients. This is a retrospective review of an electronic quality assurance database of patients presenting to an Emergency Department in rural Uganda staffed by non-physician clinicians trained in emergency care. Relevant de-identified clinical data on patients admitted directly to the operating theater from 2011 to 2014 were analyzed in Microsoft Excel. Overall, 112 Emergency Department patients were included in the analysis and 96% received some form of laboratory testing, imaging, medication, or procedure in the ED, prior to surgery. 72% of surgical patients referred by ED received preoperative antibiotics, and preoperative fluid resuscitation was initiated in 65%. Disposition to operating theater was accomplished within 3 h of presentation for 73% of patients. 79% were successfully followed up to assess outcomes at 72 h. 92% of those with successful follow-up reported improvement in their clinical condition. The confirmed mortality rate was 5%. Specialized non-physician clinicians practicing in a dedicated Emergency Department can perform resuscitation, bedside imaging and laboratory studies to aid in diagnosis of acute surgical patients and arrange transfer to an operating theater in an efficient fashion. This model has the potential to sustainably address structural and human resources problems inherent to Sub-Saharan Africa's current acute surgical care model and will benefit from further study and expansion.

Seedlings of 10 common hosts of X. compactus were screened for preferential infestation by X. compactus, with a view to analysing the potential role of the shade trees in escalating incidence and damage by the pest. The experiment was conducted for 8 weeks in a garden of mature C. canephora infested by X. compactus that served as a natural source of infestation for the seedlings. The seedlings that became infested by X. compactus were counted weekly and the counts subjected to generalized linear modelling. Results show marked host preference by X. compactus, with T. cacao and C. canephora being the most preferred, while Eucalyptus sp. and Albizia chinensis being the least preferred. Four simulated scenarios of incidence and damage by X. compactus on a preferred crop such as C. canephora are discussed. It is suggested that it is most unlikely for unpreferred alternate host shade tree species to markedly increase populations of X. compactus on shaded preferred host plants. However, these simulations, which are based on results from potted seedlings, need to be validated in a real field situation, taking into account other ecological parameters that are likely to influence pest populations.

One of the species was recently detected attacking Ricinus communis growing in Coffea canephora gardens in Uganda. This study was undertaken to: (a) determine the distribution, incidence, and relative abundance of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis in Uganda; (b) determine the influence of the presence of C. canephora on the incidence and abundance of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis; and (c) identify ambrosia fungus of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis. Five C. canephora farms with R. communis and five others with R. communis but without C. canephora were sampled in each of the six districts surveyed. Incidence of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis was measured, by inspecting the host trees in each farm for the presence or absence of the pest. Abundance of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis was estimated, by counting holes of Euwallacea sp. at the lower 1.7 m of R. communis stems. A fungus was isolated from galleries of Euwallacea sp. on R. communis and identified. Results show that Euwallacea sp. was present on R. communis in all districts surveyed, with 30-70% of the farms infested in each district and 5-28 holes of Euwallacea sp. found on each sampled stem of R. communis. Coffea canephora appeared to facilitate the infestation of R. communis by Euwallacea sp., although it did not seem to influence the multiplication of the insect inside the host. Cunninghamella echinulata appeared to be the ambrosia fungus associated with Euwallacea sp. Therefore, Euwallacea sp. is a threat to many economically important plants in Uganda that are known to be hosts of this pest.

Cis-regulatory evolution in a wild primate: Infection-associated genetic variation drives differential expression of MHC-DQA1 in vitro	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY			English	Article						ecoimmunology; immunogenetics; major histocompatibility complex; red colobus; Trichuris	MAJOR HISTOCOMPATIBILITY COMPLEX; RED COLOBUS MONKEYS; CROSS-SPECIES TRANSMISSION; CLASS-II EXPRESSION; HOST LIFE-HISTORY; BALANCING SELECTION; PROMOTER REGION; GASTROINTESTINAL PARASITES; LINKAGE DISEQUILIBRIUM; NATURAL-POPULATIONS	Few studies have combined genetic association analyses with functional characterization of infection-associated SNPs in natural populations of nonhuman primates. Here, we investigate the relationship between host genetic variation, parasitism and natural selection in a population of red colobus (Procolobus rufomitratus tephrosceles) in Kibale National Park, Uganda. We collected parasitological, cellular and genomic data to test the following hypotheses: (i) MHC-DQA1 regulatory genetic variation is associated with control of whipworm (Trichuris) infection in a natural population of red colobus; (ii) infection-associated SNPs are functional in driving differential gene expression in vitro; and (iii) balancing selection has shaped patterns of variation in the MHC-DQA1 promoter. We identified two SNPs in the MHC-DQA1 promoter, both in transcription factor binding sites, and both of which are associated with decreased control of Trichuris infection. We characterized the function of both SNPs by testing differences in gene expression between the two alleles of each SNP in two mammalian cell lines. Alleles of one of the SNPs drove differential gene expression in both cell lines, while the other SNP drove differences in expression in one of the cell lines. Additionally, we found evidence of balancing selection acting on the MHC-DQA1 promoter, including extensive trans-species polymorphisms between red colobus and other primates, and an excess of intermediate-frequency alleles relative to genome-wide, coding and noncoding RADseq data. Our data suggest that balancing selection provides adaptive regulatory flexibility that outweighs the consequences of increased parasite infection intensity in heterozygotes.

Phylogenomics from Whole Genome Sequences Using aTRAM	SYSTEMATIC BIOLOGY			English	Article						aTRAM; gene assembly; genome sequencing; phylogenomics	ULTRACONSERVED ELEMENTS; READ ALIGNMENT; TREE; ENDOSYMBIONT; ENRICHMENT; THOUSANDS; NUCLEAR; RESOLVE; TAXA; AVES	Novel sequencing technologies are rapidly expanding the size of data sets that can be applied to phylogenetic studies. Currently the most commonly used phylogenomic approaches involve some form of genome reduction. While these approaches make assembling phylogenomic data sets more economical for organisms with large genomes, they reduce the genomic coverage and thereby the long-term utility of the data. Currently, for organisms with moderate to small genomes (< 1000 Mbp) it is feasible to sequence the entire genome at modest coverage (10-30x). Computational challenges for handling these large data sets can be alleviated by assembling targeted reads, rather than assembling the entire genome, to produce a phylogenomic data matrix. Here we demonstrate the use of automated Target Restricted Assembly Method (aTRAM) to assemble 1107 single-copy ortholog genes from whole genome sequencing of sucking lice ( Anoplura) and out-groups. We developed a pipeline to extract exon sequences from the aTRAM assemblies by annotating them with respect to the original target protein. We aligned these protein sequences with the inferred amino acids and then performed phylogenetic analyses on both the concatenated matrix of genes and on each gene separately in a coalescent analysis. Finally, we tested the limits of successful assembly in aTRAM by assembling 100 genes from close-to distantly related taxa at high to low levels of coverage. Both the concatenated analysis and the coalescent-based analysis produced the same tree topology, which was consistent with previously published results and resolved weakly supported nodes. These results demonstrate that this approach is successful at developing phylogenomic data sets from raw genome sequencing reads. Further, we found that with coverages above 5-10x, aTRAM was successful at assembling 80-90% of the contigs for both close and distantly related taxa. As sequencing costs continue to decline, we expect full genome sequencing will become more feasible for a wider array of organisms, and aTRAM will enable mining of these genomic data sets for an extensive variety of applications, including phylogenomics.

Maternal Influences on Access to and Use of Infant ARVs and HIV Health Services in Uganda	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						HIV-exposed infants; ART adherence; Vertical transmission of HIV; Prevention of mother to child transmission; Sub-Saharan Africa	ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; TO-CHILD TRANSMISSION; FOLLOW-UP; INFECTED CHILDREN; RANDOMIZED-TRIAL; PREVENTION; CARE; INTRAPARTUM; CHALLENGES; ZIDOVUDINE	Vertical transmission of HIV is responsible for about 14 % of new HIV cases reported each year in sub-Saharan Africa. Barriers that prevent women from accessing and using antiretroviral medications (ARVs) for themselves and their infants perpetuate the epidemic. To identify influences on access to and use of infant HIV health services, specifically nevirapine administration, we conducted a mixed methods study among HIV-positive women in Uganda. This included a cross-sectional survey (n = 384) and focus group discussions (n = 6, 5-9 participants each). Of the 384 women, 80 % gave nevirapine to their infants within 72 h of birth. Factors independently associated with nevirapine administration were lack of maternal adherence to ARVs (AOR 3.55, 95 % CI 1.36-9.26) and attending a support group (AOR 2.50, 95 % CI 1.06-5.83). Non-health facility births were inversely related to nevirapine use (AOR 0.02, 95 % CI 0.003-0.09). Focus group discussions identified four themes impacting access and use: attending a support group, health care worker attitudes, lack of partner support, and poor health messaging regarding ARVs. Improving health care worker messaging regarding ARVs and providing women with needed support to access and use infant ARV prophylaxis is critical to overcoming access barriers. Eliminating these barriers may prevent numerous HIV infections each year saving the lives of many HIV-exposed infants.

Our current understanding on the state of adaptation is limited, however, both globally and in Africa in particular. This study examines the status of adaptation in the Sahel by reviewing the primary peer review literature that reports concrete climate change adaptation actions. Based on an analysis of 70 peer review papers that document 414 discrete adaptations, we create a snap shot of adaptations developed between 1975 and 2015, and also calculate the percentages of adaptation. The results show that from a country to country perspective, Kenya has the highest number of reported adaptation actions (75 or 18.1%). The percentages indicate that the adaptive capacity of the entire study area is generally low for all the countries being that the highest country-level percentage is recorded in Kenya and it is 18%. Regionally, West Africa has more adaptation actions (261 or 63%) when compared to other regions of the Sahel. Regional level percentages suggest a higher level of adaptation at the regional level being that the percentage falls within the high scale range. The most commonly used adaptation actions reported are income diversification and water harnessing respectively. When categorized, technically related adaptation actions dominate the adaptation charts. The decade 2008-2016 recorded the highest number of adaptations (65.2%). Adaptation actions are also reported to be triggered by climatic and non-climatic drivers which both record high frequencies but the climatic drivers (98%) of adaptation are slightly dominant relative to the non-climatic drivers (95%). These results should be viewed as proxies of climate change adaptation as much information may be found in grey literature and non-peer review national communications which are left out here because of their relative low standardization and acceptability due to the absence of peer review.

Historically, the diagnosis has been made between age 12 and 24 months but now can be made before 6 months' corrected age. OBJECTIVES To systematically review best available evidence for early, accurate diagnosis of cerebral palsy and to summarize best available evidence about cerebral palsy-specific early intervention that should follow early diagnosis to optimize neuroplasticity and function. EVIDENCE REVIEW This study systematically searched the literature about early diagnosis of cerebral palsy in MEDLINE (1956-2016), EMBASE (1980-2016), CINAHL (1983-2016), and the Cochrane Library (1988-2016) and by hand searching. Search terms included cerebral palsy, diagnosis, detection, prediction, identification, predictive validity, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The study included systematic reviews with or without meta-analyses, criteria of diagnostic accuracy, and evidence-based clinical guidelines. Findings are reported according to the PRISMA statement, and recommendations are reported according to the Appraisal of Guidelines, Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument. FINDINGS Six systematic reviews and 2 evidence-based clinical guidelinesmet inclusion criteria. All included articles had high methodological Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) ratings. In infants, clinical signs and symptoms of cerebral palsy emerge and evolve before age 2 years; therefore, a combination of standardized tools should be used to predict risk in conjunction with clinical history. Before 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are term-age magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity), the Prechtl Qualitative Assessment of General Movements (98% sensitivity), and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity). After 5 months' corrected age, the most predictive tools for detecting risk are magnetic resonance imaging (86%-89% sensitivity) (where safe and feasible), the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination (90% sensitivity), and the Developmental Assessment of Young Children (83% C index). Topography and severity of cerebral palsy are more difficult to ascertain in infancy, and magnetic resonance imaging and the Hammersmith Infant Neurological Examination may be helpful in assisting clinical decisions. In high-income countries, 2 in 3 individuals with cerebral palsy will walk, 3 in 4 will talk, and 1 in 2 will have normal intelligence. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Early diagnosis begins with a medical history and involves using neuroimaging, standardized neurological, and standardized motor assessments that indicate congruent abnormal findings indicative of cerebral palsy. Clinicians should understand the importance of prompt referral to diagnostic-specific early intervention to optimize infant motor and cognitive plasticity, prevent secondary complications, and enhance caregiver well-being.

Methods: Children aged <12 years initiated first-line ART in Uganda during 2010-11. Baseline and 6 monthly viral load (VL) and genotypic resistance testing if VL. 1000 copies/mL was done. The 2015 IAS-USA mutation list and Stanford algorithm were used to score drug resistance mutations (DRMs) and susceptibility. Virological failure (VF) was defined as two consecutive VLs>1000 copies/mL or death after 6 months of ART. Factors associated with failure and acquired drug resistance (ADR) were assessed in a logistic regression analysis. Results: Among 317 children enrolled, median age was 4.9 years and 91.5% received NNRTI-based regimens. PDR was detected in 47/278 (16.9%) children, of whom 22 (7.9%) had resistance against their first-line regimen and were therefore on a partially active regimen. After 24 months of follow-up, 92/287 (32.1%) had experienced VF. Children with PDR had a higher risk of VF (OR 15.25, P<0.001) and ADR (OR 3.58, P=0.01). Conclusions: Almost one-third of children experienced VF within 24 months of NNRTI-based first-line treatment. PDR was the strongest predictor of VF and ADR, and therefore presents a major threat in children. There is a need for ART regimens that maximize effectiveness of first-line therapy for long-term treatment success in the presence of PDR or incorporation of routine VL testing to detect VF and change treatment in time, in order to prevent clinical deterioration and accumulation of additional drug resistance. Children <= 3 years should be initiated on a PI-based regimen as per WHO guidelines.

In this study, we address the hypothesis that two widely distributed sister grass lineages (broad- and fine-leaved Loliinae; hereafter BL and FL) that differ in their habitat requirements and competitive ability also differ in their biogeographic history, with particular reference to LDD. Location Global. Methods We reconstructed a comprehensive phylogeny of Loliinae, based on nuclear and plastid markers and estimated divergence times using fossil calibrations. Biogeographical events were estimated using analysis of range evolution, comparing different models. Numbers and rates of dispersals were estimated for BL and FL using stochastic mapping with best-performing and baseline biogeographical models, and examined for correlation with distance, disjunction type, and phenotypic syndrome. Results The most recent common ancestor of Loliinae likely split at the Oligocene-Miocene transition (22.50 +/- 3.95 Ma), pre-dating previous estimates, whereas the ancestors of the BL and FL Loliinae likely began to diversify in the Early Miocene (18.91 +/- 4.15 and 17.50 +/- 3.50 Ma, respectively). A model of range evolution integrating founder events and scaling of dispersal by shortest distance between areas performed best amongst a set of alternative models and recovered a mean of 83 dispersal events in Loliinae. Overall dispersal rates were significantly higher in BL than in FL. Per-route dispersal rates showed a significant negative exponential relationship to shortest distance but were not affected by phenotypic syndrome or disjunction type. Main conclusions Loliinae originated in the Northern Hemisphere and evolved through recurrent LDDs. Higher competitive ability, potentially related to the broad-leaved syndrome (i.e. tall strong-rhizomatous plants, long-living individuals, occupancy of more stable habitats), may explain higher observed dispersal rates in BL compared with FL Loliinae. However, the dominant factor impacting dispersal in both BL and FL Loliinae is the distance between suitable areas.

Dynamics of surface runoff and soil loss from a toposequence under varied land use practices in Rwizi catchment, Lake Victoria Basin	JOURNAL OF SOIL AND WATER CONSERVATION			English	Article						LakeVictoria Basin; land use system; runoff; soil loss; toposequence	FED LOWLAND RICE; EROSION RATES; MANAGEMENT; ECOSYSTEM; WATER; AFRICA; SCALE; PLOTS	In this study, we quantified surface runoff and soil loss along a toposequence considering four land use systems and three topographic segment positions in Rwizi catchment, Lake Victoria Basin (LVB). The land use systems were grassland dominated by a local species known as "Omugugu" (Cyperus spp.), tree plantation of pine (Pinus sabiniana) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globus), mulched banana (Musa Paradisiaca), and unmulched banana, topographically located on the foot slope, midslope, and summit. Runoff and soil loss magnitude and trends under varied rainfall regimes were measured using dosed runoff plots measuring 2 x 20 m (40 m(2)). A 'split plot experimental design was adopted for the study. In total, 36 runoff plots were installed considering the land use and topographic factors with three replications. Observed monthly rainfall values varied from 9.3 to 167 mm (75 54 mm). Annually, the registered rainfall depth was 680 mm. The annual rainfall depth was below the long-term annual mean for the area. Nearly all rainfall events with a depth greater than 10 mm contributed relatively heavy runoff; while rainfall events less than 10 mm in general caused minor surface runoff at the sites. Annual runoff within,the catchment at the studied sites varied from 42 to 411 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1). The average observed cross-site annual runoff was 151 +/- 95 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1). Results show that annual runoff was in the order of tree plantation > unmulched banana sites > grassland = mulched banana. Soil losses were greatest (1.5 t ha(-1) y(-1)) and lowest (0.8.t ha(-1) y(-1)) on unmulched banana and mulched banana sites, respectively. Annual soil loss showed an increase with topographic slope segment position. Average annual soil loss on the upper slope position facets (1.7 t ha(-1) y(-1)) were 2.4 folds higher than those observed on the footslope position facets (0.7 t ha(-1) y(-1)), giving a percentage difference of 83%.We did not detect a statistical difference in runoff (p > 0.05) due to either land use system or toposequence position. However, statistical differences were observed in soil loss (p < 0.05) for land use system and toposequence position. While. the observed annual soil loss magnitude is within the tolerable thresholds, a sustained maintenance of best land use practices is still critical in maintaining the delicate balance on the fragile hillslopes in the study area.

Nextgen Consortium	High performance computation of landscape genomic models including local indicators of spatial association	MOLECULAR ECOLOGY RESOURCES			English	Article						environmental correlations; genome scans; high performance computing; landscape genomics; local adaptation; spatial autocorrelation	POPULATION-STRUCTURE; ALLELE FREQUENCIES; COMPUTER-PROGRAM; GENETIC-ANALYSIS; CANDIDATE LOCI; SELECTION; ADAPTATION; MARKERS; WIDE; AUTOCORRELATION	With the increasing availability of both molecular and topo-climatic data, the main challenges facing landscape genomics - that is the combination of landscape ecology with population genomics - include processing large numbers of models and distinguishing between selection and demographic processes (e.g. population structure). Several methods address the latter, either by estimating a null model of population history or by simultaneously inferring environmental and demographic effects. Here we present SAMbADA, an approach designed to study signatures of local adaptation, with special emphasis on high performance computing of large-scale genetic and environmental data sets. SAMbADA identifies candidate loci using genotype-environment associations while also incorporating multivariate analyses to assess the effect of many environmental predictor variables. This enables the inclusion of explanatory variables representing population structure into the models to lower the occurrences of spurious genotype-environment associations. In addition, SAMbADA calculates local indicators of spatial association for candidate loci to provide information on whether similar genotypes tend to cluster in space, which constitutes a useful indication of the possible kinship between individuals. To test the usefulness of this approach, we carried out a simulation study and analysed a data set from Ugandan cattle to detect signatures of local adaptation with SAMbADA, BAYENV, LFMM and an FST outlier method (FDIST approach in ARLEQUIN) and compare their results. SAMbADA - an open source software for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X available at http://lasig.epfl.ch/sambada - outperforms other approaches and better suits whole-genome sequence data processing.

In Uganda, a low-income country with the largest pig population in East Africa, ASF is endemic. Animal disease impact is multidimensional and include social and economic impact along the value chain. In low-income settings, this impact keep people poor and push those that have managed to escape poverty back again. If the diseases can be controlled, their negative consequences can be mitigated. However, to successfully argue for investment in disease control, its cost-benefits need to be demonstrated. One part in the cost-benefit equations is disease impact quantification. The objective of this study was therefore to investigate the socio-economic impact of ASF outbreaks at household level in northern Uganda. In a longitudinal study, structured interviews with two hundred, randomly selected, pig-keeping households were undertaken three times with a six month interval. Questions related to family and pig herd demographics, pig trade and pig business. Associations between ASF outbreaks and economic and social impact variables were evaluated using linear regression models. The study showed that pigs were kept in extreme low-input-low-output farming systems involving only small monetary investments. Yearly incidence of ASF on household level was 19%. Increasing herd size was positively associated with higher economic output. The interaction between ASF outbreaks and the herd size showed that ASF outbreaks were negatively associated with economic output at the second interview occasion and with one out of two economic impact variables at the third interview occasion. No significant associations between the social impact variables included in the study and ASF outbreaks could be established. Trade and consumption of sick and dead pigs were coping strategies used to minimize losses of capital and animal protein. The results indicate that causality of social and economic impact of ASF outbreaks in smallholder systems is complex. Pigs are mostly kept as passive investments rather than active working capital, complicating economic analyses and further disqualifying disease control arguments based only on standard economic models.

Antiretroviral Therapy With Efavirenz Accentuates Pregnancy-Associated Reduction of Dihydroartemisinin-Piperaquine Exposure During Malaria Chemoprevention	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							INTERMITTENT PREVENTIVE TREATMENT; DRUG-INTERACTIONS; POPULATION PHARMACOKINETICS; NONPREGNANT WOMEN; DOUBLE-BLIND; HIV; METABOLISM; BURDEN; PLASMA; AGENTS	Dihydroartemisinin (DHA)-piperaquine is promising formalaria chemoprevention in pregnancy. We assessed the impacts of pregnancy and efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy on exposure to DHA and piperaquine in pregnant Ugandan women. Intensive sampling was performed at 28 weeks gestation in 31 HIV-uninfected pregnant women, in 27 HIV-infected pregnant women receiving efavirenz, and in 30 HIV-uninfected nonpregnant women. DHA peak concentration and area under the concentration time curve (AUC(0-8hr)) were 50% and 47% lower, respectively, and piperaquine AUC(0-21d) was 40% lower in pregnant women compared to nonpregnant women. DHA AUC(0-8hr) and piperaquine AUC(0-21d) were 27% and 38% lower, respectively, in pregnant women receiving efavirenz compared to HIV-uninfected pregnant women. Exposure to DHA and piperaquine were lower among pregnant women and particularly in women on efavirenz, suggesting a need for dose modifications. The study of modified dosing strategies for these populations is urgently needed.

The Effect of Gene Variants on Levonorgestrel Pharmacokinetics When Combined With Antiretroviral Therapy Containing Efavirenz or Nevirapine	CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY & THERAPEUTICS			English	Article							PREGNANE-X-RECEPTOR; HIV-INFECTED PATIENTS; METABOLISM IN-VITRO; PLASMA-CONCENTRATIONS; UNBOOSTED ATAZANAVIR; DRUG-METABOLISM; STEADY-STATE; CYP2B6; POLYMORPHISM; IMPLANTS	Reduced levonorgestrel concentrations fromthe levonorgestrel contraceptive implant was previously seen when given concomitantly with efavirenz. We sought to assess whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in efavirenz and nevirapine metabolismwere linked to these changes in levonorgestrel concentration. SNPs in CYP2B6, CYP2A6, NR1I2, and NR1I3 were analyzed. Associations of participant demographics and genotype with levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics were evaluated in HIV-positive women using the levonorgestrel implant plus efavirenz-or nevirapinebased antiretroviral therapy (ART), in comparison to ART-na ive women using multivariate linear regression. Efavirenz group: CYP2B6 516G>T was associated with lower levonorgestrel log(10) C-max and log(10) AUC. CYP2B6 15582C> T was associated with lower log(10) AUC. Nevirapine group: CYP2B6 516G>T was associated with higher log(10) C-max and lower log(10) C-min. Pharmacogenetic variations influenced subdermal levonorgestrel pharmacokinetics in HIV-positive women, indicating that the magnitude of the interaction with non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) is influenced by host genetics.

Quality of life among perinatally HIV-affected and HIV-unaffected school-aged and adolescent Ugandan children: a multi-dimensional assessment of wellbeing in the post-HAART era	QUALITY OF LIFE RESEARCH			English	Article						Quality of life; Perinatally acquired HIV infection; Perinatally HIV-exposed uninfected; Healthy unexposed uninfected controls; School-age; Adolescence	IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS-INFECTION; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; GENERIC CORE SCALES; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; IMPACT; COMBINATION; RELIABILITY; PEDSQL(TM); RITONAVIR	To examine quality of life (QOL) in perinatally HIV-infected (PHIV) or HIV-exposed uninfected (PHEU) vs. healthy HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) children during school-age/adolescence. PHIV infection was diagnosed via DNA PCR. Current HIV status was confirmed by HIV rapid diagnostic test. Three HIV groups were defined: PHIV, PHEU, and HUU. QOL was assessed with proxy and self-report versions of the PedsQL (TM) 4.0 instrument at 6-18 years of age. QOL scores ranged from zero (least QOL) to 100 (highest QOL) in the following dimensions: combined QOL inventory (CQOLI), multi-dimensional vigor (MDV), general wellbeing (GWB), present functioning, and general cognitive functioning (CF). Multivariable linear regression models estimated HIV-related percent differences (beta) in QOL scores and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Compared to HUU CQOLI deficits ranged from 6.5 to 9.2% (95% CI -15.4, -1.6), GWB deficit ranged from 6.5 to 10.5% (95% CI -16.0, -1.3), MDV deficit ranged from 6.8 to 11.6% (95% CI -14.5, 0.9), and CF deficit ranged from 9.7 to 13.1% for PHIV children. QOL deficits of similar magnitude and direction in most domains were observed for PHIV compared to PHEU. However, self-reported indicators of GWB (beta = -3.5; 95% CI -9.0, 2.0) and present functioning (beta = 4.0; 95% CI -4.6, 12.5) were similar for PHIV compared to PHEU. QOL scores were generally similar for PHEU compared to HUU. PHEU and HUU had similar QOL profile but PHIV predicted sustained deficits in multiple QOL domains. PHIV and PHEU children were similar with respect to general wellbeing and present functioning. Psychosocial and scholastic interventions in combination with HIV care are likely to improve QOL in PHIV.	[Nkwata, A. K.; Sekandi, J.

Our study differs methodologically from previous research in this realm in that we are using an instrumental variable quantile regression framework in order to estimate the causal effects of maternal work at various locations of the height-for-age distribution in rural India. The quantile estimates provide evidence of large heterogeneity in the effect of a mother's work on child nutrition. In particular, the results suggest that it is children in the lower tail of the distribution who experience more sizable 'nutritional premiums' due to maternal labor market participation; the effects are small and insignificant for children in the rest of the distribution.

Achieving good symptom control can be challenging. More people with advanced illness live in low and middle income than in high-income countries, but they are much less likely to receive palliative care. Most of the emerging evidence for the palliative management of chronic breathlessness is from high-income countries. This review explores the context of chronic breathlessness in low-income settings, how evidence for control of chronic breathlessness might relate to these settings and where further work should be focused. Recent findings Systems for control of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) in these low-income contexts are poorly developed and health services are often overwhelmed with high levels both of NCD and communicable disease. Multidisciplinary and holistic approaches to disease management are often lacking in these settings. Developing an integrated primary care approach to NCD management is increasingly recognized as a key strategy and this should include palliative care. Most evidence-based approaches to the control of chronic breathlessness could be adapted for use in these contexts Summary Hand held fans, breathing techniques, graded exercise and use of low-dose morphine can all be used in low-income settings particularly in the context of holistic care. Research is needed into the most effective ways of implementing such interventions and palliative care needs to be promoted as a fundamental aspect of NCD management.	[Leng, Mhoira E.

However, the impact on the health of retained patients visiting traditional healers is unknown. In 2011, a study to asses adherence to anti-retroviral therapy (ART) performed in 18 purposefully selected HIV treatment centers in Tanzania, Zambia and Uganda showed that 'consulting a traditional healer/herbalist because of HIV' was an independent risk factor for incomplete ART adherence. To identify characteristics of PLHIV on ART who were also consulting traditional healers, we conducted a secondary analysis of the data from this study. It was found that 260 (5.8%) of the 4451 patients enrolled in the study had consulted a traditional healer during the last three months because of HIV. In multivariable analysis, patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who had been on ART for >5.3 years and those from Tanzania were more likely to have consulted a traditional healer. However, at the time of the study, there was a famous healer in Manyara district, Loliondo village of Tanzania who claimed his herbal remedy was able to cure all chronic diseases including HIV. HIV treatment programs should be aware that patients with fewer HIV symptoms, those who have been on ART for five or more years, and patients attending ART centers near famous traditional healers are likely to consult traditional healers. Such patients may need more support or counseling about the risks of both stopping ART and poor adherence. Considering the realities of inadequate human resources for health and the burden of disease caused by HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, facilitating a collaboration between allopathic and traditional health practitioners is recommended.

This study examined the utility of saliva vis-a-vis serum by evaluating levels of biomarkers found in saliva and serum from TB suspects. Methods: Study enrolled tuberculosis suspects. Sputum MGIT was used as the gold standard for active TB. Quantiferon gold-In tube assay was done to identify exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). Multiplex assay was run for 10 markers using a 10 plex customized kit from Bio-Rad Laboratories. Results: There was a significant difference between saliva and serum marker levels. Saliva had significantly higher levels of GM-CSF and VEGF. Serum had higher levels of MIP-1a, b, TNF-a, G-CSF and IFN-g. Serum levels of IL-6, VEGF and TNF-a were significantly different between participants with active TB disease and those with other respiratory diseases. Conclusion: Salivary TB biomarkers are worth the search to evaluate their ability to differentiate between TB disease states for generation of a non invasive point of care test for TB diagnosis.

Delaying the start of iron until 28 days after antimalarial treatment is associated with lower incidence of subsequent illness in children with malaria and iron deficiency	PLOS ONE			English	Article							RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM MALARIA; SULFADOXINE-PYRIMETHAMINE; GUT MICROBIOTA; ANEMIA; FORTIFICATION; HEPCIDIN; THERAPY	We evaluated the incidence of all-cause and malaria-specific clinic visits during follow-up of a recent trial of iron therapy. In the main trial, Ugandan children 6-59 months with smear-confirmed malaria and iron deficiency [zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP > = 80 mu mol/mol heme)] were treated for malaria and randomized to start a 27-day course of oral iron concurrently with (immediate group) or 28 days after (delayed group) antimalarial treatment. All children were followed for the same 56-day period starting at the time of antimalarial treatment (Day 0) and underwent passive and active surveillance for malaria and other morbidity for the entire follow-up period. All ill children were examined and treated by the study physician. In this secondary analysis of morbidity data from the main trial, we report that although the incidence of malaria-specific visits did not differ between the groups, children in the immediate group had a higher incidence rate ratio of all-cause sick-child visits to the clinic during the follow-up period (Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) immediate/delayed = 1.76; 95% CI: 1.05-3.03, p = 0.033). Although these findings need to be tested in a larger trial powered for malaria-specific morbidity, these preliminary results suggest that delaying iron by 28 days in children with coexisting malaria and iron deficiency is associated with a reduced risk of subsequent all-cause illness.

We described the transition from F-75 to RUTF and identified correlates of failed transition. Methods: We conducted an observational study among children aged 6-59 months treated for SAM at Mulago hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Therapeutic feeding during transition phase was provided by first offering half of the energy requirements from RUTF and the other half from F-75 and then increasing gradually to RUTF as only energy source. The child was considered to have successfully transitioned to RUTF if child was able to gradually consume up to 135 kcal/kg/day of RUTF in the transition phase on first attempt. Failed transition to RUTF included children who failed the acceptance test or those who had progressively reduced RUTF intake during the subsequent days. Failure also included those who developed profuse diarrhoea or vomiting when RUTF was ingested. Results: Among 341 of 400 children that reached the transition period, 65% successfully transitioned from F-75 to RUTF on first attempt while 35% failed. The median (IQR) duration of the transition period was 4 (3-8) days. The age of the child, mid-upper arm circumference, weight-for-height z-score and weight at transition negatively predicted failure. Each month increase in age reflected a 4% lower likelihood of failure (OR 0.96 (95% CI 0.93; 0.99). Children with HIV (OR 2.73, 95% CI 1.27; 5.85) and those rated as severely ill by caregiver (OR 1.16, 95% CI: 1.02; 1.32) were more likely to fail. At the beginning of the rehabilitation phase, the majority (95%) of the children eventually accepted RUTF while only 5% completed rehabilitation in hospital on F-100. Conclusion: Transition from F-75 to RUTF for hospitalized children with SAM by gradual increase of RUTF was possible on first attempt in 65% of cases. Younger children, severely wasted, HIV infected and those with severe illness as rated by the caregiver were more likely to fail to transit from F-75 to RUTF on first attempt.

HIV status disclosure and associated outcomes among pregnant women enrolled in antiretroviral therapy in Uganda: a mixed methods study	REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH			English	Article						HIV status disclosure; Spousal support; Stigma; Discrimination; Violence	TO-CHILD-TRANSMISSION; SEROSTATUS DISCLOSURE; PREVENTION; PEOPLE; BARRIERS; STIGMA	Background: Disclosure of HIV positive status to sexual partners is promoted by HIV prevention programs including those targeting the prevention of mother-to-child transmission. Among other benefits, disclosure may enhance spousal support and reduce stigma, violence and discrimination. HIV status disclosure and associated outcomes were assessed among a cohort of women, newly initiating lifelong antiretroviral therapy in Uganda between October 2013 and May 2014. Methods: This was a mixed method study, drawing data from a prospective cohort study of 507 HIV positive pregnant women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy, who were followed for four months to determine disclosure and its outcomes. Women were recruited from three facilities for the cohort study; in addition, fifty-seven women were recruited to participate in qualitative interviews from six facilities. Factors associated with spousal support and negative outcomes were determined using random-effects logistic regression in two separate models, with prevalence ratio as measure of association. In-depth interviews were used to document experiences with disclosure of HIV status. Results: Overall HIV status disclosure to at least one person was high [(375/507), 83.7%]. Nearly three-quarters [(285/389), 73.3%], had disclosed to their spouse by the fourth month of follow up post-enrolment. Among married women, spousal support was high at the first 330/407 (81.1%) and second follow-up 320/389 (82.2%). The majority of women who reported spousal support for either antenatal care or HIV-related care services had disclosed their HIV status to their spouses (adj. PR = 1.17; 95% CI: 1.02-1.34). However, no significant differences were observed in the proportion of self-reported negative outcomes by HIV status disclosure (adj. PR = 0.89; 95% CI: 0.56-1.42). Qualitative findings highlighted stigma and fear of negative outcomes as the major barriers to disclosure. Conclusion: HIV status disclosure to partners by pregnant women on lifelong antiretroviral therapy was associated with increased spousal support, but was impeded by fear of adverse outcomes such as stigma, discrimination and violence. Interventions to reduce negative outcomes could enhance HIV status disclosure.

The paper used SPSS (statistical package for social scientist) and applied MedGraph program (Excel version 13), Sobel test, and Kenny & Baron guideline to test for the mediating role of social networks in the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion. Quantitative data were collected from a total sample of 400 poor households living in rural Uganda who were randomly selected for this study. The findings revealed that social networks partially mediate in the relationship between financial intermediation and financial inclusion of poor households in rural Uganda. Besides, social networks and financial intermediation have significant and positive impacts on financial inclusion of poor households in rural Uganda. This implies that some effects of financial intermediation on financial inclusion go through social networks to cause an impact on financial inclusion of poor households in rural Uganda. Therefore, financial institutions such as banks and microfinance institutions should develop financial products and services that promote social networking among poor households in rural Uganda. In addition, they should advocate for participation by poor households in existing village associations and social organizations so as to develop wide social networks. This will help them to gain access to scarce and vital information about available financial services like credit.

The study used a cross-sectional survey design to collect the data on a sample of 250 SMEs and bootstrap method was used to carry out mediation analysis. The findings revealed that innovation fully mediates the relationship between knowledge management and business performance of SMEs. The paper contributes to scholarly debate on the mediating role of innovation on the relationship between knowledge management and business performance of SMEs by providing evidence from a developing country. The results may help business owners of SMEs to adopt innovation as a conduit for knowledge management to boost their business performance.

The Access to Cardiovascular diseases, Chronic Obstructive pulmonary disease, Diabetes mellitus and Asthma Drugs and diagnostics (ACCODAD) study aimed at providing contemporary information about the availability, cost and affordability of medicines and diagnostic tests integral in the management of DM and CVD in Uganda. Methods: The study assessed the availability, cost and affordability of 37 medicines and 19 diagnostic tests in 22 public hospitals, 23 private hospitals and 100 private pharmacies in Uganda. Availability expressed as a percentage, median cost of the available lowest priced generic medicine and the diagnostic tests and affordability in terms of the number of days' wages it would cost the least paid public servant to pay for one month of treatment and the diagnostic tests were calculated. Results: The availability of the medicines and diagnostic tests in all the study sites ranged from 20.1% for unfractionated heparin (UFH) to 100% for oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) and from 6.8% for microalbuminuria to 100% for urinalysis respectively. The only affordable tests were blood glucose, urinalysis and serum ketone, urea, creatinine and uric acid. Parenteral benzathine penicillin, oral furosemide, glibenclamide, bendrofluazide, atenolol, cardiac aspirin, digoxin, metformin, captopril and nifedipine were the only affordable drugs. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that the majority of medicines and diagnostic tests essential in the management of DM and CVD are generally unavailable and unaffordable in Uganda. National strategies promoting improved access to affordable medicines and diagnostic tests and primary prevention measures of DM and CVD should be prioritised in Uganda.

A pre-test post-test study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS			English	Article						Child; Adolescent; Mental health; Training; Non-specialist health worker; Cadre; Primary care	CONTINUING MEDICAL-EDUCATION; PRIMARY-CARE; AMERICAN-COLLEGE; PREVALENCE; INTERVENTION; INTEGRATION; DISORDERS; PROGRAM; AFRICA	Background: Early identification and management of child and adolescent mental health (CAMH) disorders helps to avert mental illness in adulthood but a CAMH treatment gap exists in Uganda. CAMH integration into primary health care (PHC) through in-service training of non-specialist health workers (NSHW) using the World Health Organisation (WHO) Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) Intervention Guide (IG) is a strategy to address this gap. However, results of such training are not supported by information on training development or delivery; and are undifferentiated by NSHW cadre. We aim to describe an in-service CAMH training for NSHW in Uganda and assess cadre-differentiated learning outcomes. Methods: Thirty-six clinical officers, nurses and midwives from 18 randomly selected PHC clinics in eastern Uganda were trained for 5 days on CAMH screening and referral using a curriculum based on the mhGAP-IG version 1.0 and PowerPoint slides from the International Association of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Allied Professions (IACAPAP). The residential training was evaluated through pre- and post- training tests of CAMH knowledge and attitudes using the participants' post-test scores; and the difference between pre- test and post-test scores. Two-tailed t-tests assessed differences in mean pre- test and post-test scores between the cadres; hierarchical linear regression tested the association between cadre and post test scores; and logistic regression evaluated the relationship between cadre and knowledge gain at three pre- determined cut off points. Results: Thirty-three participants completed both pre- and post-tests. Improved mean scores from pre- to post-test were observed for both clinical officers (20% change) and nurse/midwives (18% change). Clinical officers had significantly higher mean test scores than nurses and midwives (p < 0.05) but cadre was not significantly associated with improvement in CAMH knowledge at the 10% (AOR 0.08; 95 CI [0.01, 1.19]; p = 0.066), 15% (AOR 0.16; 95% CI [0.01, 2.21]; p = 0.170), or 25% ( AOR 0.13; 95% CI [0.01, 1.74]; p = 0.122) levels. Conclusion: We aimed to examine CAMH learning outcomes by NSHW cadre. NSHW cadre does not influence knowledge gain from in-service CAMH training. Thus, an option for integrating CAMH into PHC in Uganda using the mhGAP-IG and IACAPAP PowerPoint slides is to proceed without cadre differentiation.

The mediational intervention for sensitizing caregivers (MISC) program trained caregivers on fostering daily interactions with young children. We hypothesized that MISC could enhance neurodevelopment of rural Ugandan HIV-infected children and improve mental health outcomes of their caregivers, which might mediate improved caregiving quality. Design: A randomized trial of HIV-infected young children (ages 2-5 years) and their female caregivers; cluster randomization was to MISC or a nutrition curriculum. Setting: A total of 18 geographic clusters in rural Uganda. Study participants: Children and caregivers were evaluated at baseline, 6 months, 1 year, and 1-year post-training. Main outcome measures: Mullen Scales of Early Learning, the Color-Object Association Test for memory, the Early Childhood Vigilance Test of attention, and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function for the children. Caregivers completed measures of depression and anxiety symptoms and daily functioning. Results: MISC had a significant impact on postintervention receptive language (adjusted mean difference = 3.13, 95% confidence interval 0.08, 6.18) that persisted at 1-year follow-up. MISC caregivers reported significantly less functional impairment postprogram (adjusted mean difference = -0.15, 95% confidence interval -0.28, -0.01). Other outcomes were NS. Conclusion: Both intervention conditions resulted in improvements in the study children over time. MISC showed additional impacts on child language and caregiver well-being. Future directions that include assessing the extent enhanced language development resulting from improved caregiving may better prepare impoverished children for school.

Diagnostic accuracy and acceptability of rapid HIV oral testing among adults attending an urban public health facility in Kampala, Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PERFORMANCE	Background The prevalence of HIV in Uganda is 7.3%, and yet nearly 40% of people living with HIV are unaware of their status. The current HIV testing policy which is strictly blood-based poses several challenges including: a need for high level laboratory skills, stringent waste disposal needs, and painful sample collection. It is envisaged that introduction of a rapid, painless HIV oral fluid test as a potential alternative is likely to increase the number of people testing. The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy and acceptability of rapid HIV oral testing among adults attending Kisenyi Health Centre IV in Kampala. Methods and findings We conducted a cross-sectional study among 440 adults recruited consecutively at Kisenyi Health Centre IV from January to March 2016. The diagnostic accuracy of the HIV oral test was assessed by comparing to the national HIV serial testing algorithm. We also assessed for acceptability among patients and health care workers (HCWs) by triangulating responses from a structured questionnaire, three focus group discussions and seven key informant interviews. Acceptability was defined as willingness to take the test at the time of the study and intention for future use of the test if it was availed. The prevalence of HIV infection among study participants was 14.8%. The HIV oral fluid test was highly accurate with sensitivity of 100% (95% CI; 94.5-100.0), specificity of 100% (95% CI; 99.0-100.0), positive predictive value (PPV) of 100% (95% CI; 94.5-100.0) and negative predictive value (NPV) of 100% (95% CI; 99.0-100.0). Acceptability of HIV oral testing was also high at 87.0% (95% CI; 83.6-89.9). Participants preferred HIV oral testing because it was: pain free (91%, n = 399) and did not require blood draw (82%, n = 360). Conclusion The HIV oral fluid test has high diagnostic accuracy and acceptability. HIV oral testing is a suitable addition to the national HIV testing strategies with the potential of increasing access to HIV testing services in Uganda.

However, in order to continue to expand and to sustain these services it is important that "in country" options are explored. This study sought to explore attitudes and perceptions of people living with HIV (PLHIV) and health care staff towards using a fee-based "after hours" clinic (AHC) at the Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) in Kampala, Uganda. Methods: A cross-sectional study design, using qualitative methods for data collection was used. A purposeful sample of 188 adults including PLHIV accessing care at IDI and IDI staff were selected. We conducted 14 focus group discussions and 55 in-depth interviews. Thematic content analysis was conducted and Nvivo Software Version 10 was used to manage data. Results: Findings suggested that some respondents were willing to pay for consultation, brand-name drugs, laboratory tests and other services. Many were willing to recommend the AHC to friends and/or relatives. However, there were concerns expressed of a risk that the co-pay model may lead to reduction in quality or provision of the free service. Respondents agreed that, as a sign of social responsibility, fees for service could help underprivileged patients. Conclusion: The IDI AHC clinic is perceived as beneficial to PLHIV because it provides access to HIV services at convenient times. Many PLHIV are willing to pay for this enhanced service. Innovations in HIV care delivery such as quality private-public partnerships may help to improve overall coverage and sustain quality HIV services in Uganda in the long term.

Delays in switching may contribute to accumulated drug resistance, advanced immunosuppression, increased morbidity and mortality. The 3rd 90' of UNAIDS 90:90:90 targets 90% viral suppression for persons on ART. We evaluated the rate of switching to second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the impact of delayed switching on immunologic, virologic, and mortality outcomes in the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) Clinical Cohort Study which started providing ART in 2004 and implemented 6 monthly routine virologic monitoring beginning in 2005. Methods: Retrospective cohort study of HIV-infected adults on first-line ART who had two consecutive viral loads (VLs) > 1000 copies/ml after 6 months on ART between June 2004 and June 2011 was studied for switching to second-line ART. Immunologic decline after virologic failure was defined as decrease in CD4 count of >= 50 cells/ul and virologic increase was defined as increase of 0.5 log 10 copies/ml. Competing risk models were used to summarize rates of switching to second-line ART while cox proportional hazard marginal structural models were used to assess the risk of virologic increase or immunologic decline associated with delay to switch first line ART failing patients. Results: The cumulative incidence of switching at 6, 12, and 24 months following virologic failure were 30.2%, 44.6%, and 65.0%, respectively. The switching rate was increased with higher VL at the time of virologic failure; compared to those with VLs <= 5000 copies/ml, patients with VLs = 5001-10,000 copies/ml had an aHR = 1.81 (95% CI = 0.9-3.6), and patients with VLs > 10,000 copies/ml had an aHR = 3.38 (95% CI = 1.9-6.2). The switching rate was also increased with CD4 < 100 cells/ul at ART initiation, compared to those with CD4 >= 100 cells/ul (aHR = 2.30, 95% CI = 1.5-3.6). Mortality in patients not switched to second-line ART was 11.9%, compared to 1.2% for those who switched (p = 0.009). Patients switched after 12 months of of virologic failure were more likely to experience CD4 decline and/or further VL increases. Conclusions: Intervention strategies that aid clinicians to promptly switch patients to second-line ART as soon as virologic failure on 1st line ART is confirmed should be prioritized.

A major drawback of cultures is a long turnaround-time. Recent evidence demonstrates that live and dead Cryptococcus yeasts can be distinguished using trypan blue staining. We hypothesized that trypan blue staining combined with haemocytometer counting may provide a rapid estimation of quantitative culture count and detection of CSF sterility. To test this, we evaluated 194 CSF specimens from 96 HIV-infected participants with cryptococcal meningitis in Kampala, Uganda. Cryptococcal meningitis was diagnosed by CSF cryptococcal antigen (CRAG). We stained CSF with trypan blue and quantified yeasts using a haemocytometer. We compared the haemocytometer readings versus quantitative Cryptococcus CSF cultures. Results: Haemocytometer counting with trypan blue staining had a sensitivity of 98% (64/65), while CSF cultures had a sensitivity of 95% (62/65) with reference to CSF CRAG for diagnostic CSF specimens. For samples that were positive in both tests, the haemocytometer had higher readings compared to culture. For diagnostic specimens, the median of log(10) transformed counts were 5.59 (n = 64, IQR = 5.09 to 6.05) for haemocytometer and 4.98 (n = 62, IQR = 3.75 to 5.79) for culture; while the overall median counts were 5.35 (n = 189, IQR = 4.78-5.84) for haemocytometer and 3.99 (n = 151, IQR = 2.59-5.14) for cultures. The percentage agreement with culture sterility was 2.4% (1/42). Counts among non-sterile follow-up specimens had a median of 5.38 (n = 86, IQR = 4.74 to 6.03) for haemocytometer and 2.89 (n = 89, IQR = 2.11 to 4.38) for culture. At diagnosis, CSF quantitative cultures correlated with haemocytometer counts (R-2 = 0.59, P < 0.001). At 7-14 days, quantitative cultures did not correlate with haemocytometer counts (R-2 = 0.43, P = 0.4). Conclusion: Despite a positive correlation, the haemocytometer counts with trypan blue staining did not predict the outcome of quantitative cultures in patients receiving antifungal therapy.

The effect of facility-based antiretroviral therapy programs on outpatient services in Kenya and Uganda	BMC HEALTH SERVICES RESEARCH			English	Article						Antiretroviral therapy; HIV/AIDS; Health systems; Kenya; Uganda	HEALTH SYSTEMS; NATIONAL INCIDENCE; GLOBAL BURDEN; HIV; DISEASE; AID; MORTALITY	Background: Considerable debate exists concerning the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) service scale-up on non-HIV services and overall health system performance in sub-Saharan Africa. In this study, we examined whether ART services affected trends in non-ART outpatient department (OPD) visits in Kenya and Uganda. Methods: Using a nationally representative sample of health facilities in Kenya and Uganda, we estimated the effect of ART programs on OPD visits from 2007 to 2012. We modeled the annual percent change in non-ART OPD visits using hierarchical mixed-effects linear regressions, controlling for a range of facility characteristics. We used four different constructs of ART services to capture the different ways in which the presence, growth, overall, and relative size of ART programs may affect non-ART OPD services. Results: Our final sample included 321 health facilities (140 in Kenya and 181 in Uganda). On average, OPD and ART visits increased steadily in Kenya and Uganda between 2007 and 2012. For facilities where ART services were not offered, the average annual increase in OPD visits was 4.2% in Kenya and 13.5% in Uganda. Among facilities that provided ART services, we found average annual OPD volume increases of 7.2% in Kenya and 5.6% in Uganda, with simultaneous annual increases of 13.7% and 12.5% in ART volumes. We did not find a statistically significant relationship between annual changes in OPD services and the presence, growth, overall, or relative size of ART services. However, in a subgroup analysis, we found that Ugandan hospitals that offered ART services had statistically significantly less growth in OPD visits than Ugandan hospitals that did not provide ART services. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ART services in Kenya and Uganda did not have a statistically significant deleterious effects on OPD services between 2007 and 2012, although subgroup analyses indicate variation by facility type. Our findings are encouraging, particularly given recent recommendations for universal access to ART, demonstrating that expanding ART services is not inherently linked to declines in other health services in sub-Saharan Africa.

Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are one of the most common bacterial infections in women. During pregnancy physiological changes, like frequency, mimic UTI symptoms, and therefore bacteriological cultures are needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, in developing countries antibiotic therapy is commonly initiated without culture confirmation. Methods. We investigated the prevalence of bacteriuria among pregnant women with and without UTI symptoms in Uganda. In total 2 562 urine samples were evaluated with nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests, using urine culture and/or dipslide with species identification as reference. Results. The prevalence of culture-proven UTI among pregnant women with UTI symptoms was 4%. Since treatment is initiated based only on the presence of symptoms, 96% were erroneously given antibiotics. Further, there is a high prevalence of resistance to commonly used antibiotics, with 18 % ESBL and 36 % multidrug resistant Escherichia coli strains. Nitrite, leukocyte esterase tests, and urine microscopy alone were of poor diagnostic value. Using dipslide, gynecologists and nurses, not trained in microbiology, were mostly able to identify E. coli and negative cultures. Mixed Gram-negative flora, suggesting fecal contamination was, however, in the majority of cases interpreted as a single pathogenic bacterium and would have resulted in antibiotic treatment. Conclusions. To prevent excessive use of antibiotics, dipslide possibly supported by a combination of nitrite and leukocyte esterase tests can be used. Trained frontline health care professionals correctly diagnosed E. coli UTI and negative urine cultures, which would help preventing antibiotic misuse. In addition, regular screening for antibiotic resistance would improve correct treatment.

Training mid-level providers (MLPs) in the provision of HIV and tuberculosis (TB) treatment can expand existing health workforce capacity and access to HIV services. Methods: We conducted a cluster-randomized trial of on-site clinical mentorship for HIV and TB care at 10 health facilities in rural Uganda. Twenty MLPs at 5 randomly assigned to an intervention facilities received 8 hours a week of one-on-one mentorship, every 6 weeks over a 9-month period; and another 20 at 5 control facilities received no clinical mentorship. Enrolled MLPs' clinical knowledge and competence in management of HIV and TB was assessed using case scenarios and clinical observation at baseline and immediately after the 9-month intervention. The performance of the study health facilities on 8 TB and HIV care indicators was tracked over the 9-month period using facility patient records. Results: Thirty-nine out 40 enrolled MLPs had case scenario and clinical observation scores for both the baseline and end of intervention assessments. Mentorship was associated with a mean score increase of 16.7% (95% confidence interval: 9.8 to 23.6, P< 0.001) for the case scenario assessments and 25.9% (95% confidence interval: 14.4 to 37.5, P< 0.001) for the clinical observations. On-site clinical mentorship was significantly associated with an overall improvement for 5 of the 8 health facility TB and HIV indicators tracked. Conclusions: One-on-one on-site mentorship improves individual knowledge and competence, has a downstream effect on facility performance, and is a simple approach to training MLPs for task shifting.

Methods: DBS and DBMS were prepared from 50 and 30 mu L of drug-spiked whole blood and human breast milk, respectively. Following extraction with acetonitrile and water, chromatographic separation utilised a Synergi polar column with a gradient mobile phase program consisting of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Detection and quantification was performed using a TSQ Quantum Ultra triple quadrupole mass spectrometer. The analytical method was used to evaluate NRTI drug levels in HIV-positive nursing mothers-infant pairs. Results: The assay was validated over the concentration range of 16.6-5000 ng/mL for 3TC, FTC and TFV in DBS and DBMS except for TFV in DBMS where linearity was established from 4.2-1250 ng/mL. Intra and inter-day precision (%CV) ranged from 3.5-8.7 and accuracy was within 15% for all analytes in both matrices. The mean recovery in DBS was > 61% and in DBMS > 43% for all three analytes. Matrix effect was insignificant. Median AUC(0.8) values in maternal DBS and DBMS, respectively, were 4683 (4165-6057) and 6050 (5217-6417) ng h/mL for 3TC, 3312 (2259-4312) and 4853 (4124-6691) ng h/mL for FTC and 1559 (930-1915) and 56 (45-80) ng h/mL for TFV. 3TC and FTC were quantifiable (> 16.6 ng/mL) in DBS from 2/6 and 1/6 infants respectively whereas TFV was undetectable in all infants. Conclusions: DBS and DBMS sampling for bioanalysis of 3TC, FTC and TFV is straightforward, robust, accurate and precise, and ideal for use in low-resource settings.

It was demonstrated that CB-CW and WB-CW provide significantly higher removal efficiencies for organic matter (> 59%), NH4+-N (> 76%), TN (> 37%) and phosphorus (> 71%), compared with G-CW (22%-49%). The higher pollutants removal ability of biochar-packed VFCWs was mainly attribute to the higher adsorption ability and microbial cultivation in the porous biochar media. Moreover, increasing the flooded/drained ratio from 4/8 h to 8/4 h of the tidal operation further improved around 10% of the removal of both organics and NH4+-N for biochar-packed VFCWs. The phosphorus removal was dependent on the media adsorption capacities through the whole experiment. However, the NH4+-N biodegradation by microbial communities was demonstrated to become the dominant removal mechanism in the long term treatment, which compensated the decreased adsorption capacities of the media. The study supported that the use of biochar would increase the treatment performance and elongate the lifespan of CWs under tidal operation. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) sites and periodic population- based household-level surveys can be used to identify pregnancies and retrospectively capture pregnancy outcomes to provide data for decision making. However, little is known about the performance of different methods in identifying pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes, yet this is critical in assessing improvements in reducing maternal and newborn mortality and stillbirths. Objective: To explore differences between a population-based household pregnancy survey and prospective health demographic surveillance system in identifying pregnancies and their outcomes in rural eastern Uganda. Methods: The study was done within the Iganga-Mayuge HDSS site, a member centre of the INDEPTH Network. Prospective data about pregnancies and their outcomes was collected in the routine biannual census rounds from 2006 to 2010 in the HDSS. In 2011 a cross-sectional survey using the pregnancy history survey (PHS) tool was conducted among women aged 15 to 49 years in the HDSS area. We compared differences between the HDSS biannual census updates and the PHS capture of pregnancies identified as well as neonatal and child deaths, stillbirths and abortions. Findings: A total of 10,540 women aged 15 to 49 years were interviewed during the PHS. The PHS captured 12.8% more pregnancies than the HDSS in the most recent year (20102011), though between 2006 and 2010 (earlier periods) the PHS captured only 137 (0.8%) more pregnancies overall. The PHS also consistently identified more stillbirths (18.2%), spontaneous abortions (94.5%) and induced abortions (185.8%) than the prospective HDSS update rounds. Conclusions: Surveillance sites are designed to prospectively track population-level outcomes. However, the PHS identified more pregnancy-related outcomes than the HDSS in this study. Asking about pregnancy and its outcomes may be a useful way to improve measurement of pregnancy outcomes. Further research is needed to identify the most effective methods of improving the capture of pregnancies and their outcomes within HDSS sites, household surveys and routine health information systems.

Despite these statistics, our understanding of how girls perceive adolescent pregnancy is limited. This qualitative study explored the social and contextual factors shaping the perceptions of adolescent pregnancy and childbirth among a sample of 12 currently pregnant and 14 never pregnant girls living in the rural Rakai District of Uganda. Interviews were conducted to elicit perceived risk factors for pregnancy, associated community attitudes, and personal opinions on adolescent pregnancy. Findings indicate that notions of adolescent pregnancy are primarily influenced by perceptions of control over getting pregnant and readiness for childbearing. Premarital pregnancy was perceived as negative whereas postmarital pregnancy was regarded as positive.

However, information on host genetic factors and their relationships with malaria in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda is limited. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of selected host genetic markers and their relationship to malaria incidence in the vaccine trial site of Iganga, Uganda. In a 1-year longitudinal cohort study, 423 children aged below 9 years were recruited and their malaria episodes were investigated. Host genetic polymorphisms were assessed by PCR-RFLP, haemoglobin electrophoresis and DNA sequencing. Using a multivariate negative binomial regression model, estimates of the impact of human genetic polymorphisms on malaria incidence were performed. In all statistical tests, a P value of < 0.05 was considered as significant. Results: The prevalences of sickle cell haemoglobin trait, G6PD c. 202 G > A (rs 1050828) and NOS2 -954 G > C (rs 1800482) variants were 26.6, 22.7 and 17.3%, respectively. Inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (NOS2 -954 G>C; rs 1800482) heterozygosity was associated with lower incidence of malaria in all age groups {Adjusted incident rates ratio (aIRR) 0.59; 95% CI [0.386-0.887]; P = 0.012)}. About 4% of study subjects had co-existence of sickle cell Hb trait and G6PD deficiency. Sickle cell Hb heterozygotes (Hb AS) aged less than 1 year experienced significantly more malaria episodes annually than children with normal haemoglobin (Hb AA) {aIRR = 1.98; 95% CI [1.240-3.175]; P = 0.004}. There was no significant influence of the sickle cell trait on malaria incidence among older children of 1-9 years. Conclusions: Mutation (NOS2 -954 G > C; rs 1800482) of nitric oxide synthase 2 gene promoter was associated with a lower incidence of acute malaria. The normal haemoglobin (wild genotype; HbAA) was associated with reduced malaria incidence rates during the first year of life. More understanding of the interplay between host genetics and malaria susceptibility is required.

Malaria incidence among children less than 5 years during and after cessation of indoor residual spraying in Northern Uganda	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Malaria incidence; Malaria epidemic; Indoor residual spraying		Background: In June 2015, a malaria epidemic was confirmed in ten districts of Northern Uganda; after cessation of indoor residual spraying (IRS). Epidemic was defined as an increase in incidence per month beyond one standard deviation above mean incidence of previous 5 years. Trends in malaria incidence among children-under-5-years were analysed so as to describe the extent of change in incidence prior to and after cessation of IRS. Methods: Secondary data on out-patient malaria case numbers for children-under-5-years July 2012 to June 2015 was electronically extracted from the district health management information software2 (DHIS2) for ten districts that had IRS and ten control districts that didn't have IRS. Data was adjusted by reporting rates, cleaned by smoothing and interpolation and incidence of malaria per 1000 population derived. Population data obtained from 2002 and 2014 census reports. Data on interventions obtained from malaria programme reports, rainfall data obtained from Uganda National Meteorological Authority. Three groups of districts were created; two based on when IRS ended, the third not having IRS. Line graphs were plotted showing malaria incidence vis-a-vis implementation of IRS, mass net distribution and rainfall. Changes in incidence after withdrawal of IRS were obtained using incidence rate ratios (IRR). IRR was calculated as incidence for each month after the last IRS divided by incidence of the IRS month. Poisson regression was used to test statistical significance. Results: Incidence of malaria declined between spray activities in districts that had IRS. Decline in IRR for 4 months after last IRS month was greater in the sprayed than control districts. On the seventh month following cessation of IRS, incidence in sprayed districts rose above that of the last spray month [1.74: 95% CI (1.40-2.15); and 1.26: 95% CI (1.05-1.51)]. Rise in IRR continued from 1.26 to 2.62 (95% CI 2.21-3.12) in June 2015 for districts that ended IRS in April 2014. Peak in rainfall occurred in May 2015. Conclusion: There was sustained control of malaria incidence during IRS implementation. Following withdrawal and peak in rainfall, incidence rose to epidemic proportions. This suggests a plausible link between the malaria epidemic, peak in rainfall and cessation of IRS.	[Okullo, Allen E.; Matovu, Joseph K.

The theme was Strengthening Human Genetics Research in Africa. The 210 delegates came from 21 African countries and from France, Switzerland, UK, UAE, Canada and the USA. The goal was to highlight genetic and genomic science across the African continent with the ultimate goal of improving the health of Africans and those across the globe, and to promote the careers of young African scientists in the field. A session on the sustainability of genomic research in Africa brought to light innovative and practical approaches to supporting research in resource-limited settings and the importance of promoting genetics in academic, research funding, governmental and private sectors. This meeting led to the formation of the Senegalese Society for Human Genetics.	[Diallo, R. Ndiaye; Gadji, M.; Gueye, M. V.; Diop, J. P. D.; Niang, M. Sylla; Sall, P. Lopez; Gueye, P.

Bioethanol production from spent mushroom compost derived from chaff of millet and sorghum	BIOTECHNOLOGY FOR BIOFUELS			English	Article						Pleurotus ostreatus; Lignocellulose; Ethanol; Pre-treatment; Cell walls; Biofuels	PLEUROTUS-OSTREATUS; ETHANOL-PRODUCTION; STEAM EXPLOSION; SACCHARIFICATION; PRETREATMENT; STRAW; SUBSTRATE; FERMENTATION; BAGASSE; BICOLOR	Background: In Uganda, the chaff remaining from threshed panicles of millet and sorghum is a low value, lignocellulose- rich agricultural by-product. Currently, it is used as a substrate for the cultivation of edible Oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus). The aim of this study was to assess the potential to exploit the residual post-harvest compost for saccharification and fermentation to produce ethanol. Results: Sorghum and millet chaff-derived spent oyster mushroom composts minus large mycelium particles were assessed at small-scale and low substrate concentrations (5% w/v) for optimal severity hydrothermal pre-treatment, enzyme loading and fermentation with robust yeasts to produce ethanol. These conditions were then used as a basis for larger scale assessments with high substrate concentrations (30% w/v). Millet-based compost had a low cellulose content and, at a high substrate concentration, did not liquefy effectively. The ethanol yield was 63.9 g/kg dry matter (DM) of original material with a low concentration (19.6 g/L). Compost derived from sorghum chaff had a higher cellulose content and could be liquefied at high substrate concentration (30% w/v). This enabled selected furfural-resistant yeasts to produce ethanol at up to 186.9 g/kg DM of original material and a concentration of 45.8 g/L. Conclusions: Spent mushroom compost derived from sorghum chaff has the potential to be an industrially useful substrate for producing second-generation bioethanol. This might be improved further through fractionation and exploitation of hemicellulosic moieties, and possibly the exploitation of the mycelium-containing final residue for animal feed. However, spent compost derived from millet does not provide a suitably high concentration of ethanol to make it industrially attractive. Further research on the difficulty in quantitatively saccharifying cellulose from composted millet chaff and other similar substrates such as rice husk is required.

We used a multiplex microbead immunoassay to measure antibody responses to 28 M. tuberculosis (M.tb) antigens, and assessed whether combinations of antibody responses achieve accuracy thresholds required for a TB screening test. Methods A random selection of plasma samples obtained from consecutive HIV-negative adults who were admitted to Mulago Hospital in Kampala, Uganda with cough >= 2 weeks' but <6 months' duration were analyzed for serological response to 28 M.tb antigens using an in-house multiplex microbead immunoassay. We compared the median difference of the antibody response to each antigen between patients with and without culture-confirmed TB, ranked each antigen according to variable importance (VIM), and assessed the sensitivity and specificity of combinations of antibody responses using an advanced classification algorithm, SuperLearner. Results Among the 237 patients included in the analysis, 119 (50%) were female, median age was 32 years (IQR 25, 46), and 113 (48%) had TB. Median antibody levels to eight antigens were significantly different between patients with and without TB. A panel including eight of the top ranked antigens had a sensitivity of 90.6% (95% CI 89.4, 93.8) and a specificity of 88.6% (95% CI 78.2, 97.6) (Ag85B, Ag85A, Ag85C, Rv0934-P38, Rv3881, BfrB, Rv3873, and Rv2878c). With sensitivity constrained to be >90%, specificity remained close to 70% with as few as 3 antigens included in the panels. Conclusions Measuring antibody responses to combinations of antigens could facilitate TB screening and should be further evaluated in populations being targeted for systematic screening.

Assessment of hygiene practices of pork retail outlets in Kampala district, Uganda	INTERNATIONAL FOOD RESEARCH JOURNAL			English	Article						Pork; Contamination; Hygiene practices; Kampala	TAENIA-SOLIUM CYSTICERCOSIS; PIGS; INFECTIONS; TANZANIA; COMPLEX	This study was conducted to map the distribution of pork retail outlets as well as assess their role in food borne disease transmission. Using a structured questionnaire, practices associated with hygiene related to infrastructure, workers, and equipment were assessed. Sources of pork were assessed to determine whether pork had undergone inspection, as were socio economic determinants of hygiene outcomes and risk factors for foodborne disease. There were 158 pork outlets in the five divisions of Kampala. Overall, 68% of the pork was from places where slaughtering was not authorized (ungazetted) and meat inspection not carried out. Worker hygiene score was highest (average 71%), followed by infrastructure (68.2%) and equipment (47.3%). There was a significant relation between good hygiene and the presence of a public health certificate. However only 42% of the outlets had a public health certificate. Holding a public health certificate is an important predictor of good practices. (c) All Rights Reserved	[Kungu, J.

Improving inpatient medication adherence using attendant education in a tertiary care hospital in Uganda	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR QUALITY IN HEALTH CARE			English	Article						quality improvement; quality management; training; education; human resources; leadership		Although widely utilized in resource-rich health care systems, the use of quality improvement (QI) techniques is less common in resource-limited environments. Uganda is a resource-limited country in Sub-Saharan Africa that faces many challenges with health care delivery. These challenges include understaffing, inconsistent drug availability and inefficient systems that limit the provision of clinical care. Poor adherence to prescribed inpatient medications was identified as a key shortcoming of clinical care on the internal medicine wards of Mulago National Referral Hospital, Kampala, Uganda. Baseline data collection revealed a pre-intervention median inpatient medication adherence rate of 46.5% on the study ward. Deficiencies were also identified in attendant (lay caretaker) education, and prescriber and pharmacy metrics. A QI team led by a resident doctor and consisting of a QI nurse, a pharmacist and a ward nurse supervisor used standard QI techniques to address this issue. Plan-Do-Study-Act cycle interventions focused on attendant involvement and education, physician prescription practices and improving pharmacy communication with clinicians and attendants. Significant improvements were seen with an increase in overall medication adherence from a pre-intervention baseline median of 46.5% to a post-intervention median of 92%. Attendant education proved to be the most effective intervention, though resource and staffing limitations made institutionalization of these changes difficult. QI methods may be the way forward for optimizing health care delivery in resource-limited settings like Uganda. Institutionalization of these methods remains a challenge due to shortage of staff and other resource limitations.

In order to test if this clinical diversity is influenced by host genetic determinants, the association between candidate gene polymorphisms and HAT outcome was investigated in populations from HAT active foci in Guinea. Methodology and results Samples were collected from 425 individuals; comprising of 232 HAT cases, 79 subjects with long lasting positive and specific serology but negative parasitology and 114 endemic controls. Genotypes of 28 SNPs in eight genes passed quality control and were used for an association analysis. IL6 rs1818879 allele A (p = 0.0001, OR = 0.39, CI95 = [0.24-0.63], BONF = 0.0034) was associated with a lower risk of progressing from latent infection to active disease. MIF rs36086171 allele G seemed to be associated with an increased risk (p = 0.0239, OR = 1.65, CI95 = [1.07-2.53], BONF = 0.6697) but did not remain significant after Bonferroni correction. Similarly MIF rs12483859 C allele seems be associated with latent infections (p = 0.0077, OR = 1.86, CI95 = [1.18-2.95], BONF = 0.2157). We confirmed earlier observations that APOL1 G2 allele (DEL) (p = 0.0011, OR = 2.70, CI95 = [1.49-4.91], BONF = 0.0301) is associated with a higher risk and APOL1 G1 polymorphism (p = 0.0005, OR = 0.45, CI95 = [0.29-0.70], BONF = 0.0129) with a lower risk of developing HAT. No associations were found with other candidate genes. Conclusion Our data show that host genes are involved in modulating Trypanosoma brucei gambiense infection outcome in infected individuals from Guinea with IL6 rs1818879 being associated with a lower risk of progressing to active HAT. These results enhance our understanding of host-parasite interactions and, ultimately, may lead to the development of new control tools.

However, the mechanisms of parental depression on children's development are understudied in these countries. This study examined the prevalence of parental depression, contextual predictors of parental depression, and the associations between parental depression, parenting and children's development in one of the Sub-Saharan African countries-Uganda. Three hundred and three Ugandan parents of young children were recruited and interviewed. Results indicated that about 28 % of parents were depressed. Contextual factors such as low educational attainment, food insecurity, low social support, and high number of children were associated with parental depression. Structural equation modeling also indicated that Ugandan parents' depression was associated with less optimal parenting, and higher problem behavior, lower social competence, and poorer physical health and school functioning in children. Results provide several cross cultural consistency evidence in associations among parental depression, parenting, and child development.

Five diets were tested, which included the control (tethering on natural pastures), tethering supplemented with molasses (CM) and the three diets whereby tethering was supplemented with molasses as well as F. natalensis and H. abyssinica as follows: Harrisonia/ molasses (HM), Ficus/molasses (FM) and Ficus/Harrisonia/molasses (FHM). The supplements were formulated to supply crude protein (CP) and energy levels required for an average daily gain of about 50 g/day. Four farms in the same geographical location were used. Each farm had all the five diets with two goats per diet. The goats were tethered during the day (10:00-18:00 h) and the supplements offered overnight (after tethering). The dry matter (DM) intake from tethering ranged between 124 and 162 g/day, and was not affected (P > 0.05) the basal DM intake. However, the total DM and CP intakes were increased (P < 0.05) by supplementation with the browse foliages. The total DM and CP intakes were highest (P < 0.05) for FM (572 and 91 g/day, respectively) and FHM (638 and 102 g/day, respectively). Compared with the control, supplementation with browse foliages increased (P < 0.05) the average daily gain, hot carcass weight and dressing percentage by up to 37.2, 2.3 and 6%, respectively. Average daily gain was 17, 34, 45, 52 and 54 g/day for control, CM, FM, HM and FHM, respectively. The hot carcass weight was 6.9, 8.2, 8.8, 9.1 and 9.2 kg for control, CM, FM, HM and FHM, respectively. In conclusion, Ficus natalensis and Harrisonia abyssinica foliages have the potential to be used as low cost protein supplements in low-input goat feeding systems. However, there is need to establish best presentation methods of the browse foliages to the goats.

Prevalence and Correlates of Use of Safer Conception Methods in a Prospective Cohort of Ugandan HIV-Affected Couples with Fertility Intentions	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Safer conception; HIV; Uganda; Timed unprotected intercourse	SERO-DISCORDANT COUPLES; SOUTH-AFRICA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; SERODISCORDANT COUPLES; WOMEN; CARE; MEN; CLIENTS; DETERMINANTS; PREVENTION	We examined the prevalence and correlates of safer conception methods (SCM) use in HIV-affected couples with fertility intentions. A prospective cohort of 400 HIV clients in Uganda who had fertility intentions with their partner was surveyed every 6 months for 24 months. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine individual, relationship and provider level predictors of SCM use. Over one-third (35%) reported any use of timed unprotected intercourse (TUI) during the study; use of other SCM was rare. Baseline predictors of any TUI use included lower social support, greater perceived provider stigma of childbearing, greater SCM awareness, greater control over sexual decision making in the relationship, inconsistent condom use, and the belief that a desire for childbearing impedes condom use. These findings highlight the need for policy and provider training regarding integration of safer conception counselling into family planning and reproductive health services for people living with HIV.

Conception among people living with HIV carries risks for both horizontal and vertical HIV transmission. In Uganda similar to 100,000 HIV-infected women become pregnant annually. Providers face a number of challenges to preventing HIV transmission, reducing unplanned pregnancies, and ensuring safer conception. We report findings from interviews with 27 HIV-affected couples (54 individuals) in Uganda. We explored key cultural and structural factors shaping couples' childbearing decisions. Our data reveal a complex intersection of gender norms, familial expectations, relationship dynamics, and HIV stigma influencing their decisions. Participants provided insights regarding provider bias, stigma, and the gendering of reproductive healthcare. To reduce horizontal transmission HIV and family planning clinics must address men's and women's concerns regarding childbearing with specific attention to cultural and structural challenges.

How Do We Get Partners to Test for HIV?: Predictors of Uptake of Partner HIV Testing Following Individual Outpatient Provider Initiated HIV Testing in Rural Uganda	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Partner HIV testing; Sub-Saharan Africa; HIV prevention	SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; PREGNANT-WOMEN; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; MARRIED INDIVIDUALS; EASTERN UGANDA; ANTENATAL CARE; MENTAL-HEALTH; COUPLES; PREVENTION; DISCLOSURE	In a sample of outpatients (152 females, 152 males) receiving individual provider-initiated HIV testing and counselling (PITC) we aimed to identify factors associated with subsequent uptake of partner HIV testing. Purposively sampled outpatients receiving PITC at a Ugandan hospital completed a questionnaire immediately prior to testing for HIV, and then at 3 and 6 months post-test. By 6-month follow-up 96% of participants reported disclosing their HIV test results to their partner and 96.4% reported asking their partner to test. 38.8% of women and 78.9% of men reported that their partner tested and they knew their results. Recent (men AOR 5.84, 95.0% CI 1.90-17.99; women AOR 6.19, 95.0% CI 2.74-13.59) or any previous testing by the partner (women AOR 4.01, 95% CI 1.06-15.10) predicted uptake of partner testing by the 6-month follow-up. Among women, perceiving greater social support from their partner, which perhaps reflects better relationship quality, was predictive of their male partner testing for HIV (AOR 2.37, 95% CI 1.22-4.58). Notably intimate partner violence showed no negative association with partner testing. Our findings demonstrate that women are at a disadvantage compared to men in their ability to influence their partner to test for HIV, and that improving social support in intimate relationships should be a focus of HIV partner testing interventions. However, more research on interventions to improve partner testing is needed, particularly in identifying effective ways to support women in engaging their partners to test.

Methods: Focus group studies evaluated how diarrhea was understood by caregivers (content validity). The sensitivity, reliability, and correlations between dehydration and diary scores (construct validity) were tested in a clinical trial. Results: Caregivers recognized and understood the concept and severity of diarrhea. Stool frequency and liquid consistency decreased in children admitted with diarrhea (P < 0.0001 for both), confirming good sensitivity of the diary. High reliability was obtained after a few days of training. The caregiver intracorrelation coefficients were 0.66 (0.55-0.77) and 0.75 (0.66-0.84) after 2 and 7 days of training, respectively, and subjective staff evaluation of caregiver scores showed that <= 6% of caregivers had low scoring abilities after 3 days. The degree of dehydration (4-point score) was correlated with both increasing stool frequency and liquid stool consistency (+0.2 points [0.07-0.3], P = 0.0018 for 6 or more diarrheal stools, compared to 3 or more diarrheal stools per day, and +0.5 points (0.3-0.6), P < 0.0001 for diarrheal episodes with 3 or more watery stools/day compared with episodes with 3 or more "watery+abnormally loose+loose'' stools per day). Conclusions: The diary showed high validity, good reliability, and high sensitivity. After 3 days of training, caregivers with mainly no or limited education could report stool consistency with good reliability. Stool consistency, which correlated strongly with dehydration, may be considered an important marker of diarrhea severity in future research.

A cross-sectional survey aimed at evaluating the current level of practices regarding antibiotic use in farm animals in Rwanda was carried out countrywide. Interviews were conducted on 229 farmers rearing different types of animals. The study has revealed that almost all respondent farmers could name at least one antibiotic used in farm animals and peni-streptomycin was named by most of them (95.6%). The use of antibiotics in farm animals was observed in the majority of respondents (97.4%). It was found that 44.4 and 26.5% of respondents reported that they used antibiotics for disease prevention and growth promotion, respectively. The use of non-prescribed antibiotics in animals was also reported by more than the half of respondent farmers (55.6%). The majority of farmers had a moderate level of practices regarding antibiotic use in farm animals (73.5%), very few had a high level (26%) and only one respondent had a low level. The high level of practices in regard to antibiotic use in animals was associated with the location of the farm, the type of reared animals, and the rearing system. The results of this study give an insight into antibiotics usage practices in farm animals in Rwanda. The generated information can guide sensitizations and promotions of the prudent use of antibiotics among farmers in order to limit the increase of antibiotic resistance in the country.

However, little research has examined whether depression alleviation improves work-related outcomes in this population, which is the focus of this analysis. A sample of 1028 depressed HIV clients in Uganda enrolled in a comparative trial of depression care models and were surveyed over 12 months. Serial regression analyses examined whether depression alleviation (measured by the nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire) was associated with change in self-reported weekly amount of hours worked and income earned, and whether these relationships were mediated by change in work-related self-efficacy. Among those with major depression, depression alleviation was associated with nearly a doubling of weekly hours worked in bivariate analysis. The relationship between depression alleviation and hours worked was partially mediated by change in work self-efficacy among those with major depression, as well as those with minor depression, in multivariate regression analysis that controlled for demographic and health covariates. Depression alleviation was not significantly associated with change in weekly income. These findings suggest that depression alleviation benefits work functioning at least in part through improved confidence to engage in work-related activities. Integration of depression care services into HIV care may be important for improving the economic well-being of people living with HIV.

Methods: We compared baseline and changes in insulin resistance [homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)] and in markers of inflammation over 48 weeks, in a subset of antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive Ugandan children from the Children with HIV in Africa-Pharmacokinetics and Adherence/Acceptability of Simple Antiretroviral Regimens trial randomized to zidovudine-, stavudine- or abacavir (ABC)-based regimen. Nonparametric methods were used to explore between-group and within-group differences, and multivariable analysis to assess associations of HOMA-IR. Results: One-hundred eighteen children were enrolled, and median age (interquartile range) was 2.8 years (1.7-4.3). Baseline median HOMA-IR (interquartile range) was 0.49 (0.38-1.07) and similar between the arms. At week 48, median relative changes in HOMA-IR were 14% (-29% to 97%) in the zidovudine arm, -1% (-30% to 69%) in the stavudine arm and 6% (-34% to 124%) in the ABC arm (P <= 0.03 for all the arms compared with baseline, but P = 0.90 for between-group differences). Several inflammation markers significantly decreased in all study arms; soluble CD14 increased on ABC and did not change in the other 2 arms. In multivariate analysis, only changes in soluble CD163 were positively associated with HOMA-IR changes. Conclusions: In ART-naive Ugandan children, HOMA-IR changed significantly after 48 weeks of ART and correlated with monocyte activation.

The purpose of this study was to analyze the presentation and outcome of IA and compare with those from both similar and high-income country settings. A retrospective review of prospectively collected data from patient charts and pediatric surgical database for 2012-2015 was performed. Epidemiological data and patient characteristics were analyzed and outcomes were compared with those reported in other LMICs and high-income countries (HICs). Unmet need was calculated along with economic valuation or economic burden of surgical disease. Of 98 patients, 42.9% were male. 35 patients had duodenal atresia (DA), 60 had jejunio-ileal atresia (JIA), and 3 had colonic atresia. The mean age at presentation was 7.14 days for DA and 6.7 days for JIA. Average weight for DA and JIA was 2.2 and 2.12 kg, respectively. All patients with DA and colonic atresia underwent surgery, and 88.3% of patients with JIA had surgery. Overall mortality was 43% with the majority of deaths attributable to aspiration, anastomotic leak, and sepsis. 3304 DALYs were calculated as met compared to 25,577 DALYs' unmet. Patients with IA in Uganda present late in the clinical course with high morbidity and mortality attributable to a combination of late presentation, poor nutrition status, surgical complications, and likely underreporting of associated anomalies rather than surgical morbidity alone.

We aimed to assess the effect of this intervention on staff members' mental health, sense of job satisfaction and perception of school climate. We analysed data from a cluster-randomised trial administered in 42 primary schools in Luwero district, Uganda. The trial was comprised of cross-sectional baseline (June/July 2012) and endline (June/July 2014) surveys among staff and students. Twenty-one schools were randomly selected to receive the Toolkit, whilst 21 schools constituted a wait-listed control group. We generated composite measures to assess staff members' perceptions of the school climate and job satisfaction. The trial is registered at clinicaltrials. gov (NCT01678846). No schools dropped out of the study and all 591 staff members who completed the endline survey were included in the analysis. Staff in schools receiving the Toolkit had more positive perspectives of their school climate compared to staff in control schools (difference in mean scores 2.19, 95% Confidence Interval 0.92, 3.39). We did not find any significant differences for job satisfaction and mental health. In conclusion, interventions like the Good School Toolkit that reduce physical violence by school staff against students can improve staff perceptions of the school climate, and could help to build more positive working and learning environments in Ugandan schools.

In the VOICE and FEM-PrEP trials, however, TDF/FTC-based PrEP did not prevent HIV acquisition among women in eastern and southern Africa. Tenofovir was detected in plasma, reflecting exposure and adherence in recent days, in fewer than one-third of participants. Drug concentrations in hair, which represent cumulative exposure and adherence over weeks to months, have never previously been examined among women on PrEP. We compared tenofovir hair concentrations among women assigned to oral TDF/FTC in the VOICE trial to those among men and transgender women enrolled in 2 open-label PrEP studies, the iPrEx open-label extension (OLE) study and the U.S. PrEP Demonstration Project (PrEP Demo). Tenofovir hair concentrations were detectable in 55% of person-visits in VOICE, 75% of personvisits in iPrEx OLE (p = .006), and 98% of person-visits in PrEP Demo (p < .001). Median tenofovir hair concentrations corresponded to an estimated 0.2, 2.9, and 6.0 TDF/FTC doses taken per week in the three studies, respectively. In VOICE, combining tenofovir concentration data from plasma and hair suggested inconsistent, low-level product use. Incorporation of both short-and long-term adherence measures may allow for an improved understanding of patterns of drug-taking among women during global PrEP roll-out.

Few studies have determined the crystalloid of choice in obstetric anesthesia. We compared the effects of Ringer's lactate (RL) versus 0.9% normal saline (NS) on maternal and neonatal blood pH and 24-hour postoperative morbidity in urgent cesarean delivery in a low-resource setting. Our hypothesis was that RL would result in 30% less acidosis than NS. METHODS: This was a pragmatic prospective double-blind randomized controlled trial in the Mulago National Referral Hospital Labor Ward Theater from September 2011 to May 2012. Five hundred parturients were studied; 252 were randomly assigned to NS and 248 to RL groups. Preoperative and postoperative maternal venous blood gases and placental umbilical arterial cord blood gases were analyzed. The primary outcome was incidence of maternal acidosis, as defined by a postoperative drop in venous pH below 7.32 or reduction in base excess below -3 in a previously normal parturient. Maternal 24-hour postoperative morbidity, neonatal pH, and neonatal base excess were the main secondary outcomes. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01585740. RESULTS: The overall incidence of maternal acidosis was 38% in NS and 29% in RL (relative risk, 1.29; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.66; P = .04). Thirty-two percent of parturients in NS experienced a drop in venous pH below 7.32 postoperatively, compared with 19% in RL (relative risk, 1.65; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-2.31; P = .003). The comparative drop in base excess postoperatively below -3 between the 2 groups was not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in the incidence of maternal 24-hour postoperative morbidity events and neonatal outcomes between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: NS may be a safe choice for intraoperative fluid therapy in urgent cesarean delivery as RL, albeit with an increased incidence of metabolic acidosis.

In low-income countries like Uganda, many such stockpiles are the result of donations. If not adequately monitored or regulated, expired pharmaceuticals may be repackaged and sold as counterfeits or be dumped without any thought of the potential environmental damage. The rates of pharmaceutical expiry in the supply chain need to be reduced and the disposal of expired pharmaceuticals needs to be made both timely and safe. Many low- and middle-income countries need to: (i) strengthen public systems for medicines' management, to improve inventory control and the reliability of procurement forecasts; (ii) reduce stress on central medical stores, through liberalization and reimbursement schemes; (iii) strengthen the regulation of drug donations; (iv) explore the salvage of officially expired pharmaceuticals, through re-analysis and possible shelf-life extension; (v) strengthen the enforcement of regulations on safe drug disposal; (vi) invest in an infrastructure for such disposal, perhaps based on ultra-high-temperature incinerators; and (vii) include user accountability for expired pharmaceuticals within the routine accountability regimes followed by the public health sector.

Myocardial strain is a more sensitive indicator of cardiac performance than traditional measures of systolic function. Objective: The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that abnormalities in myocardial strain may be present in children with latent rheumatic heart disease. Methods: Standard echocardiography images with electrocardiogram gating were obtained from Ugandan children found to have latent rheumatic heart disease as well as control subjects. Traditional echocardiography measures of systolic function were obtained, and offline global longitudinal strain analysis was performed. Comparison between groups was performed using strain as a continuous (Mann-Whitney U-test) and categorical (cut-off 5th percentile for age) variable. Results: Our study included 14 subjects with definite rheumatic heart disease, 13 with borderline rheumatic heart disease, and 112 control subjects. None of the subjects had abnormal left ventricular size or ejection fraction. Global longitudinal strain was lower than the 5th percentile in 44% of the subjects with any rheumatic heart disease (p = 0.002 versus controls) and 57% of the subjects with definite rheumatic heart disease (p = 0.03). The mean absolute strain values were significantly lower when comparing subjects with any rheumatic heart disease with controls (20.4 +/- 3.95 versus 22.4 +/- 4.35, p = 0.025) and subjects with definite rheumatic heart disease with controls (19.9 +/- 4.25 versus 22.4 +/- 4.35, p = 0.033). Conclusion: Global longitudinal strain is decreased in subjects with rheumatic heart disease in the absence of abnormal systolic function. Larger studies with longer-term follow-up are required to determine whether there is a role for strain to help better understand the pathophysiology of latent rheumatic heart disease.

Thus, pre-emptive policies for future malaria control require projections based on integrated models that can accommodate complex interactions of both climatic and non-climatic factors that define malaria landscape. In this paper, we combined Geographical Information System (GIS) and Bayesian belief networks (BBN) to generate GIS-BBN models that predicted malaria hotspots in 2030, 2050 and 2100 under representative concentration pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5. We used malaria data of children of SSA, gridded environmental and social-economic data together with projected climate data from the 21 Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 models to compile the GIS-BBN models. Our model on which projections were made has an accuracy of 80.65% to predict the high, medium, low and no malaria prevalence categories correctly. The non-spatial BBN model projection shows a moderate variation in malaria reduction for the high prevalence category among RCPs. Under the low prevalence category, an increase in malaria is seen but with little variation ranging between 4.6 and 5.6 percentage points. Spatially, under RCP 4.5, most parts of SSA will have medium malaria prevalence in 2030, while under RCP 8.5, most parts will have no malaria except in the highlands. Our BBN-GIS models show an overall shift of malaria hotspots from West Africa to the eastern and southern parts of Africa especially under RCP 8.5. RCP 8.5 will not expand the high and medium malaria prevalence categories in all the projection years. The generated probabilistic maps highlight future malaria hotspots under climate change on which pre-emptive policies can be based.

Indoor residual spraying (IRS) and long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) are the primary tools for malaria prevention in Africa. It is not known whether reductions in malaria can be sustained after IRS is discontinued. Our aim in this study was to assess changes in malaria morbidity in an area of Uganda with historically high transmission where IRS was discontinued after a 4-year period followed by universal LLIN distribution. Methods. Individual-level malaria surveillance data were collected from 1 outpatient department and 1 inpatient setting in Apac District, Uganda, from July 2009 through November 2015. Rounds of IRS were delivered approximately every 6 months from February 2010 through May 2014 followed by universal LLIN distribution in June 2014. Temporal changes in the malaria test positivity rate (TPR) were estimated during and after IRS using interrupted time series analyses, controlling for age, rainfall, and autocorrelation. Results. Data include 65 421 outpatient visits and 13 955 pediatric inpatient admissions for which a diagnostic test for malaria was performed. In outpatients aged < 5 years, baseline TPR was 60%-80% followed by a rapid and then sustained decrease to 15%-30%. During the 4-18 months following discontinuation of IRS, absolute TPR values increased by an average of 3.29% per month (95% confidence interval, 2.01%-4.57%), returning to baseline levels. Similar trends were seen in outpatients aged >= 5 years and pediatric admissions. Conclusions. Discontinuation of IRS in an area with historically high transmission intensity was associated with a rapid increase in malaria morbidity to pre-IRS levels.

Quantification of multiple waterborne pathogens in drinking water, drainage channels, and surface water in Kampala, Uganda, during seasonal variation	GEOHEALTH			English	Article						pathogen; enteric; water; seasonality	HEPATITIS-A VIRUS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; QUANTITATIVE PCR; CHILDREN; DIARRHEA; EFFLUENTS; INDICATOR; IMPACTS; ASSAYS	Longitudinal water quality monitoring is important for understanding seasonal variations in water quality, waterborne disease transmission, and future implications for climate change and public health. In this study, microfluidic quantitative polymerase chain reaction (MFQPCR) was used to quantify genes from pathogens commonly associated with human intestinal infections in water collected from protected springs, a public tap, drainage channels, and surface water in Kampala, Uganda, from November 2014 to May 2015. The differences in relative abundance of genes during the wet and dry seasons were also assessed. All water sources tested contained multiple genes from pathogenic microorganisms, with drainage channels and surface waters containing a higher abundance of genes as compared to protected spring and the public tap water. Genes detected represented the presence of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Vibrio cholerae, and enterovirus. There was an increased presence of pathogenic genes in drainage channels during the wet season when compared to the dry season. In contrast, surface water and drinking water sources contained little seasonal variation in the quantity of microbes assayed. These results suggest that individual water source types respond uniquely to seasonal variability and that human interaction with contaminated drainage waters, rather than direct ingestion of contaminated water, may be a more important contributor to waterborne disease transmission. Furthermore, future work in monitoring seasonal variations in water quality should focus on understanding the baseline influences of any one particular water source given their unique complexities. Plain Language Summary Individual water source types respond uniquely to seasonal variability and that human interaction with contaminated drainage waters, rather than direct ingestion of contaminated water, may be a more important contributor to waterborne disease transmission.

The application of ETo methods with fewer input requirements is necessary under limited climatic data conditions. The FAO-PM method under limited data conditions and nine of Valiantzas' equations were evaluated for daily ETo estimation in a humid climate in Uganda. The FAO-PM method with missing relative humidity data performed very well across Uganda, whereas using the long-term local wind speed average values in place of missing wind speed data resulted in inaccurate ETo estimates. Under missing solar radiation measurements, the FAO-PM method showed different performances relative to the locations. When more than one climatic variable is missing, the FAO-PM method yielded poor ETo estimates compared to the FAO-PM method with full climatic data. The performance of Valiantzas' equations depends on data requirements: the more meteorological inputs, the higher the ETo accuracy. (C) 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.

Methods: Eight hundred participants (400 HIV- and 400 antiretroviral-naive HIV+) in the Rakai Community Cohort Study underwent detailed neurologic evaluations including assessment of neuropathy symptoms, functional measures (Patient Assessment of Own Functioning Inventory and Karnofsky Performance Status scores), and neurologic evaluation by a trained medical officer. Neuropathy was defined as >= 1 subjective symptom and >= 1 sign of neuropathy on examination. Neuropathy risk factors were assessed using log binomial regression. Results: Fifty-three percent of participants were men, with a mean (SD) age of 35 (8) years. Neuropathy was present in 13% of the cohort and was more common in HIV+ vs HIV- participants (19% vs 7%, p < 0.001). Older age (relative risk [RR] 1.04, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.06), female sex (RR 1.49, 95% CI 1.04-2.15), HIV infection (RR 2.82, 95% CI 1.86-4.28), tobacco use (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.02-2.48), and prior neurotoxic medication use (RR 2.08, 95% CI 1.07-4.05) were significant predictors of neuropathy in the overall cohort. Only older age was associated with neuropathy risk in the HIV+ (RR 1.03, 95% CI 1.01-1.05) and HIV- (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.10) cohorts. Neuropathy was associated with impaired functional status on multiple measures across all participant groups. Conclusions: Peripheral neuropathy is relatively common and associated with impaired functional status among adults in rural Uganda.

In this context, we aimed to explore satisfaction of people treated in mental health in-patient facilities. The project was a part of the Young Psychiatrist Program by the Association for the Improvement of Mental Health Programmes. This is an international multicentre cross-sectional study conducted in 25 hospitals across 11 countries. The research team at each study site approached a consecutive target sample of 30 discharged patients to measure their satisfaction using the five-item study-specific questionnaire. Individual and institution level correlates of 'low satisfaction' were examined by comparisons of binary and multivariate associations in multilevel regression models. A final study sample consisted of 673 participants. Total satisfaction scores were highly skewed towards the upper end of the scale, with a median total score of 44 (interquartile range 38-48) out of 50. After taking clustering into account, the only independent correlates of low satisfaction were schizophrenia diagnosis and low psychiatrist to patient ratio. Further studies on patients' satisfaction should additionally pay attention to treatment expectations formed by the previous experience of treatment, service-related knowledge, stigma and patients' disempowerment, and power imbalance.

This study examines the pathways through which mothers are affected by seasonal and meteorological factors in sub-Saharan Africa in general, and Kanungu District (Uganda), in particular. We conducted a community-based study consisting of focus group discussions with mothers and interviews with health care workers in Kanungu District. Using a priori and a posteriori coding, we found a diversity of perspectives on the impacts of seasonal and weather exposures, with reporting of more food available in the rainy season. The rainy season was also identified as the period in which women performed physical labour for longer time periods, while work conditions in the dry season were reported to be more difficult due to heat. The causal pathways through which weather and seasonality may be affecting size at birth as reported by Kanungu mothers were consistent with those most frequently reported in the literature elsewhere, including maternal energy balance (nutritional intake and physical exertion output) and seasonal illness. While both Indigenous and non-Indigenous mothers described similar pathways, however, the severity of these experiences differed. Non-Indigenous mothers frequently relied on livestock assets or opportunities for less taxing physical work than Indigenous women, who had fewer options when facing food shortages or transport costs. Findings point to specific entry points for intervention including increased nutritional support in dry season periods of food scarcity, increased diversification of wage labour opportunities, and increased access to contraception. Interventions should be particularly targeted towards Indigenous mothers as they face greater food insecurity, may have fewer sources of income, and face greater overall deprivation than non-Indigenous mothers.

However, the best strategies for an ASP are not definitively established and are likely to vary based on local culture, policy, and routine clinical practice, and probably limited resources in middle-income countries. The aim of this study is to evaluate structures and resources of antimicrobial stewardship teams (ASTs) in surgical departments from different regions of the world. Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted in 2016 on 173 physicians who participated in the AGORA (Antimicrobials: A Global Alliance for Optimizing their Rational Use in Intra-Abdominal Infections) project and on 658 international experts in the fields of ASPs, infection control, and infections in surgery. Results: The response rate was 19.4%. One hundred fifty-six (98.7%) participants stated their hospital had a multidisciplinary AST. The median number of physicians working inside the team was five [interquartile range 4-6]. An infectious disease specialist, a microbiologist and an infection control specialist were, respectively, present in 80.1, 76.3, and 67.9% of the ASTs. A surgeon was a component in 59.0% of cases and was significantly more likely to be present in university hospitals (89.5%, p < 0.05) compared to community teaching (83.3%) and community hospitals (66.7%). Protocols for pre-operative prophylaxis and for antimicrobial treatment of surgical infections were respectively implemented in 96.2 and 82.3% of the hospitals. The majority of the surgical departments implemented both persuasive and restrictive interventions (72.8%). The most common types of interventions in surgical departments were dissemination of educational materials (62.5%), expert approval (61.0%), audit and feedback (55.1%), educational outreach (53.7%), and compulsory order forms (51.5%). Conclusion: The survey showed a heterogeneous organization of ASPs worldwide, demonstrating the necessity of a multidisciplinary and collaborative approach in the battle against antimicrobial resistance in surgical infections, and the importance of educational efforts towards this goal.

Although unsafe abortion rates have fallen from 54 to 39 per 1000 women aged 15-45years over a decade, absolute figures show a rise from 294000 in 2003 to 314000 women having unsafe abortions in 2013. Unfortunately, only 50% of the women who develop abortion complications are able to reach facilities for postabortion care. Despite the clinical evidence and the stories from undocumented cases, debate on access to safer and legal abortion is constricted, moralized, and stigmatized. The harm reduction model has shown evidence of benefit in reducing maternal mortality and morbidity due to unsafe abortion while addressing related stigma and discrimination and advancing women's reproductive health rights. This article presents a case for promoting the model in Uganda.

Burden of Surgical Conditions in Uganda A Cross-sectional Nationwide Household Survey	ANNALS OF SURGERY			English	Article						burden of disease; community survey; global surgery; household survey; low and middle-income countries; prevalence study; sub-Saharan Africa; surgical epidemiology; Uganda	COUNTRYWIDE SURVEY; PEDIATRIC-SURGERY; GLOBAL BURDEN; SIERRA-LEONE; PREVALENCE; CAPACITY; DISEASE; RWANDA; CARE; VALIDATION	Objective: To quantify the burden of surgical conditions in Uganda. Background: Data on the burden of disease have long served as a cornerstone to health policymaking, planning, and resource allocation. Population-based data are the gold standard, but no data on surgical burden at a national scale exist; therefore, we adapted the Surgeons OverSeas Assessment of Surgical Need survey and conducted a nation-wide, cross-sectional survey of Uganda to quantify the burden of surgically treatable conditions. Methods: The 2-stage cluster sample included 105 enumeration areas, representing 74 districts and Kampala Capital City Authority. Enumeration occurred from August 20 to September 12, 2014. In each enumeration area, 24 households were randomly selected; the head of the household provided details regarding any household deaths within the previous 12 months. Two household members were randomly selected for a head-to-toe verbal interview to determine existing untreated and treated surgical conditions. Results: In 2315 households, we surveyed 4248 individuals: 461 (10.6%) reported 1 or more conditions requiring at least surgical consultation [95% confidence interval (CI) 8.9%-12.4%]. The most frequent barrier to surgical care was the lack of financial resources for the direct cost of care. Of the 153 household deaths recalled, 53 deaths (34.2%; 95% CI 22.1%46.3%) were associated with surgically treatable signs/symptoms. Shortage of time was the most frequently cited reason (25.8%) among the 11.6% household deaths that should have, but did not, receive surgical care (95% CI 6.4%-16.8%). Conclusions: Unmet surgical need is prevalent in Uganda. There is an urgent need to expand the surgical care delivery system starting with the district-level hospitals. Routine surgical data collection at both the health facility and household level should be implemented.

The problem is important since temperature governs a variety of geologic processes, including the generation of magmas and the deformation style of rocks. Since the thermal properties of rocks depend strongly on temperature the problem is non-linear. The problem is formulated as an ill-posed operator equation, where the righthand side is the heat-flux at the surface level. Since the problem is ill-posed regularization is needed. In this study we demonstrate that Tikhonov regularization can be implemented efficiently for solving the operator equation. The algorithm is based on having a code for solving a well-posed problem related to the above mentioned operator. The algorithm is designed in such a way that it can deal with both 2D and 3D calculations. Numerical results, for 2D domains, show that the algorithm works well and the inverse problem can be solved accurately with a realistic noise level in the surface data.

Such controlled experiments failed to represent variable field conditions, and rarely included crop growth feedback. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of biochar, in comparison to green manure and mineral nitrogen, on greenhouse gas Emissions Intensity (EI = emissions in CO2 equivalents per ton of grain yield) in a low -fertility tropical Ultisol. Using a field trial in western Kenya, biochar (0 and 2.5 t ha(-1); made from Eucalyptus wood) was integrated with urea (0 and 120 kg N ha(-1)) and green manure (Tithonia diversifolia; 0, 2.5 and 5 t ha -1) in a factorial design for four consecutive seasons from October 2012 to August 2014. Compared to the control, biochar increased soil CO2 emissions (9-33%), reduced soil CH4 uptake (7-59%) and reduced soil N2O emissions (1-42%) in each season, with no seasonal differences. N2O emissions increased following amendment with T. diversifolia (6%) and urea (13%) compared to the control. Generally, N2O emissions decreased where only biochar was applied. The greatest decrease in N2O (42%) occurred where all three amendments were applied compared to when they were added separately. EI in response to any of the amendments was lower than the control, ranging from 9 to 65% (33.0 3.2 = mean SE): The amendments increased SOC stocks by 0.1-1.2 t ha(-1) year(-1) (mean SE of 0.8 0.09 t ha(-1) year(-1)). The results suggest decreased net EI with biochar in low fertility soils mainly through greater net primary productivity (89% of the decrease).

Cost-effectiveness of cervical cancer screening methods in low- and middle-income countries: A systematic review	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CANCER			English	Review						human papillomavirus; cost-effectiveness analysis; cervical cancer; screening; low- and middle-income countries	HUMAN-PAPILLOMAVIRUS VACCINATION; NATURAL-HISTORY MODEL; LOW-RESOURCE SETTINGS; VISUAL INSPECTION; TEST-PERFORMANCE; ACETIC-ACID; PREVENTION; IMPACT; POLICY; STRATEGIES	The incidence of cervical cancer in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is five times higher than that observed in high-income countries (HICs). This discrepancy is largely attributed to the implementation of cytology-based screening programmes in HICs. However, due to reduced health system infrastructure requirements, HPV testing (self- and provider-collected) and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) have been proposed as alternatives that may be better suited to LMICs. Knowing the relative value of different screening options can inform policy and the development of sustainable prevention programs. We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE for English language publications detailing model-based cost-effectiveness analyses of cervical cancer screening methods in LMICs from 2000 to 2016. The main outcome of interest was the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Quantitative data were extracted to compare commonly evaluated screening methods and a descriptive review was conducted for each included study. Of the initial 152 articles reviewed, 19 met inclusion criteria. Generally, cytology-based screening was shown to be the least effective and most costly screening method. Whether provider-collected HPV testing or VIA was the more efficient alternative depended on the cost of the HPV test, loss to follow-up and VIA test performance. Self-collected HPV testing was cost-effective when it yielded population coverage gains over other screening methods. We conclude that HPV testing and VIA are more cost-effective screening methods than cytology in LMICs. Policy makers should consider HPV testing with self-collection of samples if it yields gains in population coverage.

Cerebrospinal fluid kynurenine and kynurenic acid concentrations are associated with coma duration and long-term neurocognitive impairment in Ugandan children with cerebral malaria	MALARIA JOURNAL			English	Article						Cerebral malaria; Kynurenine; Kynurenic acid; Cognition; Coma; Cytokines; INF-gamma; TNF	COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; HIPPOCAMPAL PLASTICITY; PATHWAY INHIBITION; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; SCHIZOPHRENIA; METABOLITES; ENCEPHALITIS; GALANTAMINE; ASTROCYTES; ELEVATIONS	Background: One-fourth of children with cerebral malaria (CM) retain cognitive sequelae up to 2 years after acute disease. The kynurenine pathway of the brain, forming neuroactive metabolites, e.g. the NMDA-receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA), has been implicated in long-term cognitive dysfunction in other CNS infections. In the present study, the association between the kynurenine pathway and neurologic/cognitive complications in children with CM was investigated. Methods: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of KYNA and its precursor kynurenine in 69 Ugandan children admitted for CM to Mulago Hospital, Kampala, Uganda, between 2008 and 2013 were assessed. CSF kynurenine and KYNA were compared to CSF cytokine levels, acute and long-term neurologic complications, and long-term cognitive impairments. CSF kynurenine and KYNA from eight Swedish children without neurological or infectious disease admitted to Astrid Lindgren's Children's Hospital were quantified and used for comparison. Results: Children with CM had significantly higher CSF concentration of kynurenine and KYNA than Swedish children (P < 0.0001 for both), and CSF kynurenine and KYNA were positively correlated. In children with CM, CSF kynurenine and KYNA concentrations were associated with coma duration in children of all ages (P = 0.003 and 0.04, respectively), and CSF kynurenine concentrations were associated with worse overall cognition (P = 0.056) and attention (P = 0.003) at 12-month follow-up in children >= 5 years old. Conclusions: CSF KYNA and kynurenine are elevated in children with CM, indicating an inhibition of glutamatergic and cholinergic signaling. This inhibition may lead acutely to prolonged coma and long-term to impairment of attention and cognition.

ASTRO-CM Study Team	Acridine orange fluorescent microscopy is more sensitive than India ink light microscopy in the rapid detection of cryptococcosis among CrAg positive HIV patients	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FLOW-CYTOMETRY; MENINGITIS; UGANDA; BURDEN	Background India ink microscopy on cerebrospinal fluid is still utilized in resource limited settings for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis despite its poor sensitivity. We hypothesized that staining fungal nucleic acids with fluorescent dyes instead of the capsule with India ink might improve sensitivity for the diagnosis of cryptococcal meningitis. Methods We enrolled 96 HIV-infected participants with cryptococcal meningitis who provided 194 CSF specimens at serial time points in Kampala, Uganda. Cryptococcosis was diagnosed by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) test and only positive samples were included. We stained CSF with India ink and acridine orange. We cultured the same samples on standard fungal media. We compared acridine orange to CrAg, India ink and CSF culture. Results Acridine orange was more sensitive (96%) than India ink (79%) with reference to CSF CrAg. Acridine orange and India ink had a statistically significant difference (P<0.001) with a 25% correlation for detection of Cryptococcus yeasts. India ink had more negative results (22%) than acridine orange (4%). The sensitivity for India ink increased (86%) while that of acridine orange did not change (97%) when compared to CSF culture. However, both India ink and acridine orange had poor predictive values with reference to culture. Conclusion Acridine orange is a better alternative to India ink in the rapid detection of cryptococcosis among CrAg positive HIV patients.

Research purpose: The main aim of this study was to examine the contribution of work characteristics and risk propensity in promoting pro-social rule breaking among teachers in one of the Ugandan districts that has a high number of private schools. Motivation for the study: As there is a scarcity of research on pro-social rule breaking in Uganda, this study sought to explore the concept and shed light on the mechanisms that influence this. Research design, approach and method: A quantitative research process formed the basis for this study. Two hundred and forty-two teachers from 15 private secondary schools in Wakiso District formed the targeted sample size. A response rate of 87% was registered. A hierarchical regression analysis was conducted in order to assess the influence of each of the variables on the dependent variable, by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Main findings: The regression results showed that work characteristics were a statistically significant predictor of pro-social rule breaking, but risk propensity was not. The results finally showed that there was no moderation effect of risk propensity on the relationship between work characteristics and pro-social rule breaking. Practical implications: The schools should expect more pro-social rule-breaking tendencies when the tasks given to the teachers are complex and when the teachers operate with autonomy. The environment in which the private secondary school teachers in Uganda work, motivates them to sometimes break rules in a bid to perform better or minimise the complexity associated with work. Contribution: This study expands on current theoretical knowledge on pro-social rule breaking and provides insights into the key drivers of the same among private secondary school teachers in the Ugandan context.

Increased suicidal risk is a predictor of future attempted and completed suicides and has been associated with poor quality of life and poor adherence with antiretroviral therapy. Clinical risk factors have low predictive value for suicide, hence the interest in potential neurobiological correlates and specific heritable markers of suicide vulnerability. The serotonin transporter gene has previously been implicated in the aetiology of increased suicidal risk in non-HIV infected study populations and its variations may provide a platform for identifying genetic risk for suicidality among PLWHA. The present cross-sectional study aimed at identifying two common genetic variants of the serotonin transporter gene and their association with increased suicidal risk among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive adults in Uganda. Results: The prevalence of increased suicidal risk (defined as moderate to high risk suicidality on the suicidality module of the Mini Neuropsychiatric Interview (M. I. N. I) was 3.3% (95% CI, 2.0-5.3). The 5-HTTLPR was found to be associated with increased suicidal risk before Bonferroni correction (p-value = 0.0174). A protective effect on increased suicidal risk was found for the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 SA allele (p-value = 0.0046)- which directs reduced expression of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTT). Conclusion: The SA allele at the 5-HTTLPR/rs25531 locus is associated with increased suicidal risk among Ugandan PLWHA. Further studies are needed to validate this finding in Ugandan and other sub-Saharan samples.

Effects of the Informed Health Choices primary school intervention on the ability of children in Uganda to assess the reliability of claims about treatment effects: a cluster-randomised controlled trial	LANCET			English	Article							METAANALYSIS	Background Claims about what improves or harms our health are ubiquitous. People need to be able to assess the reliability of these claims. We aimed to evaluate an intervention designed to teach primary school children to assess claims about the effects of treatments (ie, any action intended to maintain or improve health). Methods In this cluster-randomised controlled trial, we included primary schools in the central region of Uganda that taught year-5 children (aged 10-12 years). We excluded international schools, special needs schools for children with auditory and visual impairments, schools that had participated in user-testing and piloting of the resources, infant and nursery schools, adult education schools, and schools that were difficult for us to access in terms of travel time. We randomly allocated a representative sample of eligible schools to either an intervention or control group. Intervention schools received the Informed Health Choices primary school resources (textbooks, exercise books, and a teachers' guide). Teachers attended a 2 day introductory workshop and gave nine 80 min lessons during one school term. The lessons addressed 12 concepts essential to assessing claims about treatment effects and making informed health choices. We did not intervene in the control schools. The primary outcome, measured at the end of the school term, was the mean score on a test with two multiple-choice questions for each of the 12 concepts and the proportion of children with passing scores on the same test. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, number PACTR201606001679337. Findings Between April 11, 2016, and June 8, 2016, 2960 schools were assessed for eligibility; 2029 were eligible, and a random sample of 170 were invited to recruitment meetings. After recruitment meetings, 120 eligible schools consented and were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n=60, 76 teachers and 6383 children) or control group (n=60, 67 teachers and 4430 children). The mean score in the multiple-choice test for the intervention schools was 62.4% (SD 18.8) compared with 43.1% (15.2) for the control schools (adjusted mean difference 20.0%, 95% CI 17.3-22.7; p<0.00001). In the intervention schools, 3967 (69%) of 5753 children achieved a predetermined passing score (>= 13 of 24 correct answers) compared with 1186 (27%) of 4430 children in the control schools (adjusted difference 50%, 95% CI 44-55). The intervention was effective for children with different levels of reading skills, but was more effective for children with better reading skills. Interpretation The use of the Informed Health Choices primary school learning resources, after an introductory workshop for the teachers, led to a large improvement in the ability of children to assess claims about the effects of treatments. The results show that it is possible to teach primary school children to think critically in schools with large student to teacher ratios and few resources. Future studies should address how to scale up use of the resources, long-term effects, including effects on actual health choices, transferability to other countries, and how to build on this programme with additional primary and secondary school learning resources.

Effects of the Informed Health Choices podcast on the ability of parents of primary school children in Uganda to assess claims about treatment effects: a randomised controlled trial	LANCET			English	Article							EDUCATION; BENEFITS; HARMS	Background As part of the Informed Health Choices project, we developed a podcast called The Health Choices Programme to help improve the ability of people to assess claims about the benefits and harms of treatments. We aimed to evaluate the effects of the podcast on the ability of parents of primary school children in Uganda to assess claims about the effects of treatments. Methods We did this randomised controlled trial in central Uganda. We recruited parents of children aged 10-12 years who were in their fifth year of school at 35 schools that were participating in a linked trial of the Informed Health Choices primary school resources. The parents were randomly allocated (1: 1), via a web-based random number generator with block sizes of four and six, to listen to either the Informed Health Choices podcast (intervention group) or typical public service announcements about health issues (control group). Randomisation was stratified by parents' highest level of formal education attained (primary school, secondary school, or tertiary education) and the allocation of their children's school in the trial of the primary school resources (intervention vs control). The primary outcome, measured after listening to the entire podcast, was the mean score and the proportion of parents with passing scores on a test with two multiple choice questions for each of nine key concepts essential to assessing claims about treatments (18 questions in total). We did intention-to-treat analyses. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry, number PACTR201606001676150. Findings We recruited parents between July 21, 2016, and Oct 7, 2016. We randomly assigned 675 parents to the podcast group (n=334) or the public service announcement group (n=341); 561 (83%) participants completed follow-up. The mean score for parents in the podcast group was 67.8% (SD 19.6) compared with 52.4% (17.6) in the control group (adjusted mean difference 15.5%, 95% CI 12.5-18.6; p<0.0001). In the podcast group, 203 (71%) of 288 parents had a predetermined passing score (>= 11 of 18 correct answers) compared with 103 (38%) of 273 parents in the control group (adjusted difference 34%, 95% CI 26-41; p<0.0001). No adverse events were reported. Interpretation Listening to the Informed Health Choices podcast led to a large improvement in the ability of parents to assess claims about the effects of treatments. Future studies should assess the long-term effects of use of the podcast, the effects on actual health choices and outcomes, and how transferable our findings are to other countries.

Supporting and retaining Village Health Teams: an assessment of a community health worker program in two Ugandan districts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR EQUITY IN HEALTH			English	Article						Community health workers; Village health teams; Community health volunteers; Uganda; Sustainability; Retention; Support; Attrition; Health workforce	RURAL UGANDA; INCENTIVES; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; STRATEGIES; MOTIVATION; MOZAMBIQUE; RESOURCES; COUNTRIES; SYSTEMS	Background: Uganda's national community health worker program involves volunteer Village Health Teams (VHTs) delivering basic health services and education. Evidence demonstrates their positive impact on health outcomes, particularly for Ugandans who would otherwise lack access to health services. Despite their impact, VHTs are not optimally supported and attrition is a growing problem. In this study, we examined the support needs and existing challenges of VHTs in two Ugandan districts and evaluated specific factors associated with long-term retention. We report on findings from a standardized survey of VHTs and exploratory interviews with key stakeholders and draw conclusions that inform efforts to strengthen and sustain community health care delivery in Uganda. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was employed through a survey of 134 individual VHT members and semi-structured interviews with six key stakeholders. Descriptive and bivariate regression analysis of quantitative survey data was performed along with thematic analysis of qualitative data from surveys and interviews. In the regression analysis, the dependent variable is 10-year anticipated longevity among VHTs, which asked respondents if they anticipate continuing to volunteer as VHTs for at least 10 more years if their current situation remains unchanged. Results: VHTs desire additional support primarily in the forms of money (e.g. transportation allowance) and material supplies (e.g. rubber boots). VHTs commonly report difficult working conditions and describe a lack of respect from their communities and other health workers. If their current situation remains unchanged, 57% of VHTs anticipate remaining in their posts for at least 10 years. Anticipated 10-year longevity was positively associated with stronger partnerships with local health center staff and greater ease in home visiting. Conclusions: Supporting and retaining Uganda's VHTs would be enhanced by building stronger partnerships between VHTs and other health workers and regularly providing supplies and transportation allowances. Pursuing such measures would likely improve equity in access to healthcare for all Ugandans.

We conducted an investigation to identify the mode of transmission to guide control measures. Methods: We defined a suspected case as onset of acute watery diarrhoea from 1 February 2015 onwards in a Kasese resident. A confirmed case was a suspected case with Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor, serotype Inaba cultured from a stool sample. We reviewed medical records to find cases. We conducted a case-control study to compare exposures among confirmed case-persons and asymptomatic controls, matched by village and age-group. We conducted environmental assessments. We tested water samples from the most affected area for total coliforms using the Most Probable Number (MPN) method. Results: We identified 183 suspected cases including 61 confirmed cases of Vibrio cholerae 01; serotype Inaba, with onset between February and July 2015. 2 case-persons died of cholera. The outbreak occurred in 80 villages and affected all age groups; the highest attack rate occurred in the 5-14 year age group (4.1/10,000). The outbreak started in Bwera Sub-County bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo and spread eastward through sustained community transmission. The first case-persons were involved in cross-border trading. The case-control study, which involved 49 confirmed cases and 201 controls, showed that 94% (46/49) of case-persons compared with 79% (160/201) of control-persons drank water without boiling or treatment (ORM-H= 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3-18). Water collected from the two main sources, i.e., public pipes (consumed by 39% of case-persons and 38% of control-persons) or streams (consumed by 29% of case-persons and 24% control-persons) had high coliform counts, a marker of faecal contamination. Environmental assessment revealed evidence of open defecation along the streams. No food items were significantly associated with illness. Conclusions: This prolonged, community-wide cholera outbreak was associated with drinking water contaminated by faecal matter and cross-border trading. We recommended rigorous disposal of patients' faeces, chlorination of piped water, and boiling or treatment of drinking water. The outbreak stopped 6 weeks after these recommendations were implemented.	[Kwesiga, Benon; Pande, Gerald; Ario, Alex Riolexus; Matovu, Joseph K.

EQUIP Study Team	Effects of the EQUIP quasi-experimental study testing a collaborative quality improvement approach for maternal and newborn health care in Tanzania and Uganda	IMPLEMENTATION SCIENCE			English	Article							SCALE-UP; SOUTHERN TANZANIA; DISTRICT-LEVEL; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; INTERVENTIONS; EXPERIENCES; SERVICES; PROGRAM; SUPPORT	Background: Quality improvement is a recommended strategy to improve implementation levels for evidence-based essential interventions, but experience of and evidence for its effects in low-resource settings are limited. We hypothesised that a systemic and collaborative quality improvement approach covering district, facility and community levels, supported by report cards generated through continuous household and health facility surveys, could improve the implementation levels and have a measurable population-level impact on coverage and quality of essential services. Methods: Collaborative quality improvement teams tested self-identified strategies (change ideas) to support the implementation of essential maternal and newborn interventions recommended by the World Health Organization. In Tanzania and Uganda, we used a plausibility design to compare the changes over time in one intervention district with those in a comparison district in each country. Evaluation included indicators of process, coverage and implementation practice analysed with a difference-of-differences and a time-series approach, using data from independent continuous household and health facility surveys from 2011 to 2014. Primary outcomes for both countries were birth in health facilities, breastfeeding within 1 h after birth, oxytocin administration after birth and knowledge of danger signs for mothers and babies. Interpretation of the results considered contextual factors. Results: The intervention was associated with improvements on one of four primary outcomes. We observed a 26percentage- point increase (95% CI 25-28%) in the proportion of live births where mothers received uterotonics within 1 min after birth in the intervention compared to the comparison district in Tanzania and an 8-percentage-point increase (95% CI 6-9%) in Uganda. The other primary indicators showed no evidence of improvement. In Tanzania, we saw positive changes for two other outcomes reflecting locally identified improvement topics. The intervention was associated with an increase in preparation of clean birth kits for home deliveries (31 percentage points, 95% CI 2-60%) and an increase in health facility supervision by district staff (14 percentage points, 95% CI 0-28%). Conclusions: The systemic quality improvement approach was associated with improvements of only one of four primary outcomes, as well as two Tanzania-specific secondary outcomes. Reasons for the lack of effects included limited implementation strength as well a relatively short follow-up period in combination with a 1-year recall period for population-based estimates and a limited power of the study to detect changes smaller than 10 percentage points.

J	Wandera, MN; Kasumba, B				Wandera, Margaret N.; Kasumba, Betsy			"Ebinyo" - The Practice of Infant Oral Mutilation in Uganda.	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Review						infant oral mutilation; ebinyo; traditional healers; Uganda; canines	DENTAL MUTILATION; EXTIRPATION; MANAGEMENT; EDUCATION; HEALTH; FORM	Infant oral mutilation (IOM) is a traditional method of extracting un-erupted teeth practiced in several Sub-Saharan African countries including Uganda. This practice is referred to as "ebinyo" by Bantu-speaking Ethnic groups, though it has several terms depending on cultural group and researcher. The un-erupted tooth is gouged out as a cure for medical symptoms in infants that include high fevers and diarrhea. The spreading of IOM practice in African populations is blamed on poor health literacy with regard to the common childhood illnesses. One study in Uganda revealed that adverse cases following IOM seen in the hospital peaked in tandem with the malaria and diarrheal disease cases. This paper is a review of the practice with a particular focus on Uganda as presented in literature compiled from PubMed, Dentaid, Google Scholar, Local Uganda sources, and the authors' observations. The paper explains reason for the persistence of the practice, and to further inform on IOM to health practitioners who were previously unaware of the practice.

It examines the relationships between the existence of an institutional framework, data production capacity and other resource availability in the institutionalisation of policy units in health systems. It therefore contributes to our understanding of the dynamics linking the key drivers and indicators of institutionalisation. Additionally, it examines how factors within the managerial setting, including workplace environment, and budgetary and human resource availability, may influence the institutionalisation process. Methods: The study used an explanatory qualitative case study approach, examining two policy units in Burkina Faso's Ministry of Health, the first of which had been institutionalised successfully and the other less so. Data were collected from key policymakers, including 13 connected with the first policy unit and 10 with the second, plus two funders. We also conducted a documentary analysis of the National Program for Health Development, two midterm strategic plans, 230 action plans, eight Ministry of Health state budgets, eight Ministry of Health annual statistics reports, 16 policy unit budgets and published literature. Results: The framework within which the government gave the policy unit its mandate and policy focus had the strongest effect on the institutionalisation process. Institutionalisation depended on political will, in both the host government and any donors, and the priority given to the policy unit's focus. It was also affected by the leadership of the policy unit managers. These factors were influenced by human resource capacity, and our findings suggest that, for successful institutionalisation in Burkina Faso's health system, policy units need to be given sufficient human resources to achieve their objectives. Conclusion: Policy units' institutionalisation in Burkina Faso's health system depend on the leadership of the unit managers to implement relevant activities, mobilise funding, and recruit and maintain enough human resources, as well as the mandate given by the government.

Nursing partnership activities, Components, and outcomes: Health Volunteers overseas in Uganda 2001-2016	FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						collaboration; partnerships; education; evaluation; nursing	SUSTAINABILITY; COLLABORATION	Nurses increasingly form global health partnerships through academic and voluntary organizations that are designed to improve health outcomes. Many such partnerships are funded for specific time periods and have short- or long-term goals to achieve during the partnership. Other partnerships are sustained for longer periods of time through the efforts of partners committed to their joint work. The case example of the Health Volunteers Overseas Nursing Education partnership in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrates key components of partnerships that promote sustainability of programs. This case example is analyzed using literature that reports partnership models to identify those factors that have led to sustainability. Additionally, both objective and subjective program outcomes are reported. Recommendations for further evaluation are included.

However, the mentoring relationship is vulnerable to a number of challenges that may undermine its effectiveness and sustainability. We aimed to explore the experiences and perceptions of student and junior faculty mentees and senior faculty mentors at the Makerere University College of Health Sciences and identify the key factors defined by mentees and mentors as necessary for a successful mentorship program. Methods: A qualitative design involving focus group discussions (FGDs) and key informant interviews (KII) was used. A total of eight KII and four FGDs were conducted, audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Open coding of the transcripts was performed, and major themes were identified through multiple readings based on thematic analysis. Results: Six key themes were shared by the mentees and mentors including: 1) defining the role of the mentor; 2) desired characteristics of a mentor and a mentoring relationship, with an emphasis on mutual trust and respect; 3) overlapping roles of mentors and supervisors; 4) issues with the process for identifying mentors, including the benefits and drawbacks of the mentee selecting mentor vs. being assigned a mentor; 5) current barriers to mentoring, including lack of knowledge about current program, lack of formal structure, uncertainly about who should initiate relationship, and unclear roles and expectations and 6) recommendations for the future development of mentoring programme, including the need for a formalized programme, and training adapted to the local context. Conclusions: The mentees and mentors described the role of the mentor and desired characteristics of mentors and a mentoring relationship similarly. Most concerns about mentoring occurred when current mentoring programmes and practices were not well aligned with these desired characteristics. Recommendations for future development of mentoring included greater formalization of mentoring with mentoring programmes based on shared expectations and adapted to the local context.

Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional design was employed. Data were collected using a survey questionnaire for the independent variables of coercive, mimetic normative isomorphism as well as organizational culture (mediating variable). The data for the dependent and control variable were obtained from content analysis of financial reports of 92 companies and was analysed using partial least squares PLSSEM. Findings: The results indicate that coercive and normative isomorphic mechanisms are positively related voluntary disclosure while mimetic mechanism is not. Organizational culture partially mediates the relationship between isomorphic influences and voluntary disclosure practices of listed firms in Nigeria. Research Limitation/implication: The cross-sectional nature of the study means that it does not capture changes in the Nigerian business environment overtime. Future research may consider a longitudinal study. The study is not industry specific as such may capture industry differences. However, the result is still considered valid since industry category was controlled for. Practical implication: the result has implication for a number of interested parties such as regulatory bodies, accounting professional bodies, external auditors academics, and mangers. Originality/value: The study, it has contributed to our understanding of the mediating effect of organizational culture on the relationship between isomorphic mechanisms and voluntary disclosure from the perspective of a developing country like Nigeria.

Kanyawara Virus: A Novel Rhabdovirus Infecting Newly Discovered Nycteribiid Bat Flies Infesting Previously Unknown Pteropodid Bats in Uganda	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							CODON USAGE; RNA; HIPPOBOSCOIDEA; TRANSMISSION; PHYLOGENIES; STREBLIDAE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; ALIGNMENT; RESERVOIR	Bats are natural reservoir hosts of highly virulent pathogens such as Marburg virus, Nipah virus, and SARS coronavirus. However, little is known about the role of bat ectoparasites in transmitting and maintaining such viruses. The intricate relationship between bats and their ectoparasites suggests that ectoparasites might serve as viral vectors, but evidence to date is scant. Bat flies, in particular, are highly specialized obligate hematophagous ectoparasites that incidentally bite humans. Using next-generation sequencing, we discovered a novel ledantevirus (mononegaviral family Rhabdoviridae, genus Ledantevirus) in nycteribiid bat flies infesting pteropodid bats in western Uganda. Mitochondrial DNA analyses revealed that both the bat flies and their bat hosts belong to putative new species. The coding-complete genome of the new virus, named Kanyawara virus (KYAV), is only distantly related to that of its closest known relative, Mount Elgon bat virus, and was found at high titers in bat flies but not in blood or on mucosal surfaces of host bats. Viral genome analysis indicates unusually low CpG dinucleotide depletion in KYAV compared to other ledanteviruses and rhabdovirus groups, with KYAV displaying values similar to rhabdoviruses of arthropods. Our findings highlight the possibility of a yet-to-be-discovered diversity of potentially pathogenic viruses in bat ectoparasites.

Infections, including those affecting the umbilical cord (omphalitis), are a significant factor in approximately a third of these deaths. In fact, the odds of all-cause mortality are 46% higher among neonates with omphalitis than in those without. Five large randomized controlled trials in Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) have examined the effect of multiple cord stump applications with 4% chlorhexidine (CHX) for at least 7 days on the risk of omphalitis and neonatal death. These studies, all community-based, show that multiple CHX applications reduced the risk of omphalitis. Of these trials, only one study from South Asia (the Bangladeshi study) and none from Africa examined the effect of a single application of CHX as soon as possible after birth. In this Bangladeshi trial, CHX led to a reduction in the risk of mild-moderate omphalitis and neonatal death. It is important, in an African setting, to explore the effect of a single application among health-facility births. A single application is programmatically much simpler to implement than daily applications for 7 days. Therefore, our study compares umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% CHX at birth with dry cord care among Ugandan babies born in health facilities, on the risk of omphalitis and severe neonatal illness. Methods: The CHX study is a facility-based, individually randomized controlled trial that will be conducted among 4760 newborns in Uganda. The primary outcomes are severe illness and omphalitis during the neonatal period. Analysis will be by intention-to-treat. Discussion: This study will provide novel evidence, from a Sub-Saharan African setting, of the effect of umbilical cord cleansing with a single application of 4% CHX at birth and identify modifiable risk factors for omphalitis.

So far, most of the related studies have no consideration of recombinants' functionality. Here, we established a functional recombinant production (FRP) system to produce pure and functional HIV-1 intersubtype Env recombinants and utilized 454 pyrosequencing to investigate the distribution of over 4000 functional and non-functional recombination breakpoints from either the FRP system or dual infection cultures. The results revealed that most of the breakpoints converged in gp41 (62%) and C1 (25.3%) domains of gp120, which has strong correlation with the similarity between the two recombining sequences. Yet, the breakpoints also appeared in C2 (5.2%) and C5 (4.6%) domains not correlated with the recombining sequence similarity. Interestingly, none of the intersubtype gp120 recombinants recombined between C1 and gp41 regions either from the FRP system or from the dual infection culture, and very few from the HIV epidemic were functional. The present study suggests that the selection of functional Env recombinants is one of the reasons for the predominance of C1 and gp41 Env recombinants in the HIV epidemic, and it provides an in vitro model to mimic the selection of replication-competent HIV-1 intersubtype recombination in dual or superinfected patients.

Lucian			Sputum quality and diagnostic performance of GeneXpert MTB/RIF among smear-negative adults with presumed tuberculosis in Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HUMAN-IMMUNODEFICIENCY-VIRUS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; XPERT MTB/RIF; MICROSCOPY; IMPACT; ASSAY	Background Introduction of GeneXpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) assay has constituted a major breakthrough for tuberculosis (TB) diagnostics. Several patient factors may influence diagnostic performance of Xpert including sputum quality. Objective We carried out a prospective, observational, cross-sectional study to determine the effect of sputum quality on diagnostic performance of Xpert among presumed TB patients in Uganda. Methods We collected clinical and demographic information and two sputum samples from participants. Staff recorded sputum quality and performed LED fluorescence microscopy and mycobacterial culture on each sample. If both smear examinations were negative, Xpert testing was performed. We calculated diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, and other indicators for Xpert for each stratum of sputum quality in reference to a standard of mycobacterial culture. Results Patients with salivary sputum showed a trend towards a substantially higher proportion of samples that were Xpert-positive (54/286, 19%, 95% CI 15-24) compared with those with all other sputum sample types (221/1496, 15%, 95% CI 13-17). Blood-stained sputum produced the lowest sensitivity (28%; 95% CI 12-49) and salivary sputum the highest (66%; 95% CI 53-77). Specificity didn't vary meaningfully by sample types. Salivary sputum was significantly more sensitive than mucoid sputum (+ 13%, 95% CI + 1 to + 26), while bloodstained sputum was significantly less sensitive (-24%, 95% CI -42 to -5). Conclusions Our findings demonstrate the need to exercise caution in collecting sputum for Xpert and in interpreting results because sputum quality may impact test yield and sensitivity. In particular, it may be wise to pursue additional testing should blood-stained sputum test negative while salivary sputum should be readily accepted for Xpert testing given its higher sensitivity and potentially higher yield than other sample types. These findings challenge conventional recommendations against collecting salivary sputum for TB diagnosis and could inform new standards for sputum quality.	[Meyer, Amanda J.; Davis, J.

The competency-based Helping Mothers Survive Bleeding after Birth (HMS BAB) training was developed to support evidence-based management of postpartum haemorrhage. This one-day training includes low-cost MamaNatalie (R) birthing simulators and addresses both prevention and first-line treatment of haemorrhage. While evidence is accumulating that the training improves health provider's knowledge, skills and confidence, evidence is missing as to whether this translates into improved practices and reduced maternal morbidity and mortality. This cluster-randomised trial aims to assess whether this training package - involving a one-day competency-based HMS BAB in-facility training provided by certified trainers followed by 8 weeks of in-service peer-based practice - has an effect on the occurrence of haemorrhage-related morbidity and mortality. Methods/design: In Tanzania and Uganda we randomise 20 and 18 districts (clusters) respectively, with half receiving the training intervention. We use unblinded matched-pair randomisation to balance district health system characteristics and the main outcome, which is in-facility severe morbidity due to haemorrhage defined by the World Health Organizationation-promoted disease and management-based near-miss criteria. Data are collected continuously in the intervention and comparison districts throughout the 6-month baseline and the 9-month intervention phase, which commences after the training intervention. Trained facility midwives or clinicians review severe maternal complications to identify near misses on a daily basis. They abstract the case information from case notes and enter it onto programmed tablets where it is uploaded. Intention-to-treat analysis will be used, taking the matched design into consideration using paired t test statistics to compare the outcomes between the intervention and comparison districts. We also assess the impact pathway from the effects of the training on the health provider's skills, care and interventions and health system readiness. Discussion: This trial aims to generate evidence on the effect and limitations of this well-designed training package supported by birthing simulations. While the lack of blinding of participants and data collectors provides an inevitable limitation of this trial, the additional evaluation along the pathway of implementation will provide solid evidence on the effects of this HMS BAB training package.

Efficacy of an enhanced linkage to HIV care intervention at improving linkage to HIV care and achieving viral suppression following home-based HIV testing in rural Uganda: study protocol for the Ekkubo/PATH cluster randomized controlled trial	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Home-based HIV counseling and testing (HBHCT); Linkage to care; HIV viral suppression; Health behavior intervention; Cluster-randomized controlled trial; Uganda	ACTIVE ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SOCIAL SUPPORT; PSYCHOMETRIC ASSESSMENT; MEASURING RETENTION; PREGNANT-WOMEN; MEDICAL-CARE; SOUTH-AFRICA; STIGMA	Background: Though home-based human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) counseling and testing (HBHCT) is implemented in many sub-Saharan African countries as part of their HIV programs, linkage to HIV care remains a challenge. The purpose of this study is to test an intervention to enhance linkage to HIV care and improve HIV viral suppression among individuals testing HIV positive during HBHCT in rural Uganda. Methods: The PATH (Providing Access To HIV Care)/Ekkubo Study is a cluster-randomized controlled trial which compares the efficacy of an enhanced linkage to HIV care intervention vs. standard-of-care (paper-based referrals) at achieving individual and population-level HIV viral suppression, and intermediate outcomes of linkage to care, receipt of opportunistic infection prophylaxis, and antiretroviral therapy initiation following HBHCT. Approximately 600 men and women aged 18-59 who test HIV positive during district-wide HBHCT in rural Uganda will be enrolled in this study. Villages (clusters) are pair matched by population size and then randomly assigned to the intervention or standard-of-care arm. Study teams visit households and participants complete a baseline questionnaire, receive HIV counseling and testing, and have blood drawn for HIV viral load and CD4 testing. At baseline, standard-of-care arm participants receive referrals to HIV care including a paper-based referral and then receive their CD4 results via home visit 2 weeks later. Intervention arm participants receive an intervention counseling session at baseline, up to three follow-up counseling sessions at home, and a booster session at the HIV clinic if they present for care. These sessions each last approximately 30 min and consist of counseling to help clients: identify and reduce barriers to HIV care engagement, disclose their HIV status, identify a treatment supporter, and overcome HIV-related stigma through links to social support resources in the community. Participants in both arms complete interviewer-administered questionnaires at six and 12 months follow-up, HIV viral load and CD4 testing at 12 months follow-up, and allow access to their medical records. Discussion: The findings of this study can inform the integration of a potentially cost-effective approach to improving rates of linkage to care and HIV viral suppression in HBHCT. If effective, this intervention can improve treatment outcomes, reduce mortality, and through its effect on individual and population-level HIV viral load, and decrease HIV incidence.

Particular emphasis is placed on building mental health service capacity in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) where over 80% of the global population live. Consistent with this approach, concerted efforts are being made to globally disseminate psychological interventions. These initiatives must negotiate tensions that exist between making interventions sufficiently scalable, whilst retaining aspects of the psychotherapy process that maximize both the acceptability and efficacy of psychological interventions. This paper reflects on the important contribution that Contextual Behavioral Science (CBS) can make to GMH. CBS draws on behavioral and environmental principles that translate into various therapeutic applications [including Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP)] and social change initiatives (such as the PROSOCIAL approach). Consideration will be given to the cross-cultural utility and validity of CBS approaches, and the way in these can help ensure that GMH initiatives extend beyond narrow efforts to address symptoms of mental disorders to include a focus on enhancing wellbeing. It is proposed that knowledge from ACT and FAP can help build sophistication in efforts to develop and deliver 'therapist-free' psychological interventions that will need to retain sensitivity to clients' emotional expressions. In addition, the PROSOCIAL approach provides opportunities for groups of people to cooperate effectively to achieve shared aspirations and build 'communities of support' that can serve to optimize peoples' mental health and wellbeing.

We utilized plasma and serum specimens from TB patients and their contacts (age >= 12) enrolled in a household contact study in Uganda. In the discovery phase cross-sectional samples from 104 HIV-uninfected persons classified as either active TB, latent Mtb infection (LTBI), tuberculin skin test (TST) converters, or persistent TST-negative were analyzed. Two hundred eighty-nine statistically significant (false discovery rate corrected p < 0.05) differentially expressed proteins were identified across all comparisons. Proteins associated with cellular immunity and lipid metabolism were induced early after Mtb infection. One hundred and fifty-nine proteins were selected for a targeted mass spectrometry assay. A set of longitudinal samples from 52 TST-negative subjects who converted to TST-positive or remained TST-negative were analyzed, and multivariate logistic regression was used to identify unique protein panels able to predict TST conversion with cross-validated AUC > 0.85. Panel performance was confirmed with an independent validation set of longitudinal samples from 16 subjects. These candidate protein biomarkers may allow for the identification of recently Mtb infected individuals at highest risk for developing active TB and most likely to benefit from preventive therapy.

Effects of early pregnancy on uterine lymphocytes and endometrial expression of immune-regulatory molecules in dairy heifers	BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION			English	Article						pregnancy; endometrium; cattle; natural killer cells; cytotoxic T cells	NATURAL-KILLER-CELLS; MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE; INTERFERON-GAMMA; NK CELLS; T-CELLS; DENDRITIC CELLS; REPRODUCTIVE-PERFORMANCE; GALECTIN-15 LGALS15; NORMAL MURINE; LUTEAL CELLS	Natural killer (NK) cells are essential for establishment of human and rodent pregnancies. The function of these and other cytotoxic T cells (CTL) is controlled by stimulatory and inhibitory signaling. A role for cytotoxic cells during early pregnancy in cattle has not been described, but regulation of their function at the fetal-maternal interface is thought to be critical for conceptus survival. The hypothesis that the relative abundance of CTL and expression of inhibitory signaling molecules is increased by the conceptus during early pregnancy was tested. The proportions of lymphoid lineage cells and expression of inhibitory signaling molecules in the endometrium during early pregnancy in dairy heifers were determined using flow cytometry, immunofluorescence, and real-time PCR on days 17 and 20 of pregnancy and day 17 of the estrous cycle. Results revealed an increased percentage of NKp46(+) and CD8(+) cells in the uterus of pregnant heifers. Furthermore, a large percentage of uterine immune cells coexpressed these proteins. Compared to cyclic heifers, CD45(+) uterine cells from pregnant heifers exhibited greater degranulation. Endometrium from pregnant heifers had greater mRNA abundance for the inhibitory molecules, CD274 and lymphocyte activating gene 3 (LAG3), and greater cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4), molecules that can interact with receptors on antigen-presenting cells and induce lymphocyte tolerance. This study demonstrates a dynamic regulation of both cytotoxic immune cells and tolerogenic molecules during the peri-implantation period that may be required to support establishment of pregnancy and placentation.

Rare HIV-1 transmitted/founder lineages identified by deep viral sequencing contribute to rapid shifts in dominant quasispecies during acute and early infection	PLOS PATHOGENS			English	Article							NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODY; RHESUS MACAQUES; T-LYMPHOCYTES; VIRUS; ESCAPE; VIREMIA; RESPONSES; CELLS; TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTION	In order to inform the rational design of HIV-1 preventive and cure interventions it is critical to understand the events occurring during acute HIV-1 infection (AHI). Using viral deep sequencing on six participants from the early capture acute infection RV217 cohort, we have studied HIV-1 evolution in plasma collected twice weekly during the first weeks following the advent of viremia. The analysis of infections established by multiple transmitted/founder (T/F) viruses revealed novel viral profiles that included: a) the low-level persistence of minor T/F variants, b) the rapid replacement of the major T/F by a minor T/F, and c) an initial expansion of the minor T/F followed by a quick collapse of the same minor T/F to low frequency. In most participants, cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape was first detected at the end of peak viremia downslope, proceeded at higher rates than previously measured in HIV-1 infection, and usually occurred through the exploration of multiple mutational pathways within an epitope. The rapid emergence of CTL escape variants suggests a strong and early CTL response. Minor T/F viral strains can contribute to rapid and varied profiles of HIV-1 quasispecies evolution during AHI. Overall, our results demonstrate that early, deep, and frequent sampling is needed to investigate viral/host interaction during AHI, which could help identify prerequisites for prevention and cure of HIV-1 infection.

Efficient and effective care models are urgently needed for this population. We evaluated clinical outcomes of asymptomatic HIV-positive adults and children starting ART with high CD4+ counts using a novel streamlined care model in rural Uganda and Kenya. Methods: In the 16 intervention communities of the HIV test-and-treat Sustainable East Africa Research for Community Health Study (NCT01864603), all HIV-positive individuals irrespective of CD4 were offered ART (efavirenz [EFV]/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate + emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC). We studied adults (>= fifteen years) with CD4 >= 350/mu L and children (two to fourteen years) with CD4 > 500/mu L otherwise ineligible for ART by country guidelines. Clinics implemented a patient-centred streamlined care model designed to reduce patient-level barriers and maximize health system efficiency. It included (1) nurse-conducted visits with physician referral of complex cases, (2) multi-disease chronic care (including for hypertension/diabetes), (3) patient-centred, friendly staff, (4) viral load (VL) testing and counselling, (5) three-month return visits and ART refills, (6) appointment reminders, (7) tiered tracking for missed appointments, (8) flexible clinic hours (outside routine schedule) and (9) telephone access to clinicians. Primary outcomes were 48-week retention in care, viral suppression (% with measured week 48 VL <= 500 copies/mL) and adverse events. Results: Overall, 972 HIV-positive adults with CD4+ >= 350/mu L initiated ART with streamlined care. Patients were 66% female and had median age thirty-four years (IQR, 28-42), CD4+ 608/mu L (IQR, 487-788/mu L) and VL 6775 copies/mL (IQR, < 50037,003 c/mL). At week 48, retention was 92% (897/972; 2 died/40 moved/8 withdrew/4 transferred care/21/964 [2%] were lost to follow-up). Viral suppression occurred in 778/838 (93%) and 800/972 (82%) in intention-to-treat analysis. Grade III/IV clinical/laboratory adverse events were rare: 95 occurred in 74/972 patients (7.6%). Only 8/972 adults (0.8%) switched ART from EFV to lopinavir (LPV) (n = 2 for dizziness, n = 2 for gynaecomastia, n = 4 for other reasons). Among 83 children, week 48 retention was 89% (74/83), viral suppression was 92% (65/71) and grade III/IV adverse events occurred in 4/83 (4.8%). Conclusions: Using a streamlined care model, viral suppression, retention and ART safety were high among asymptomatic East African adults and children with high CD4+ counts initiating treatment.

However, antifolate and pyrethroid resistance threaten the effectiveness of these interventions, and new ones are needed. We conducted a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial comparing daily TMP-SMX plus monthly dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) to daily TMP-SMX alone in HIV-infected pregnant women in an area of Uganda where indoor residual spraying of insecticide had recently been implemented. Participants were enrolled between gestation weeks 12 and 28 and given an insecticide-treated net. The primary outcome was detection of active or past placental malarial infection by histopathologic analysis. Secondary outcomes included incidence of malaria, parasite prevalence, and adverse birth outcomes. All 200 women enrolled were followed through delivery, and the primary outcome was assessed in 194. There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of histopathologically detected placental malarial infection between the daily TMP-SMX plus DP arm and the daily TMP-SMX alone arm (6.1% vs. 3.1%; relative risk, 1.96; 95% confidence interval, .50-7.61; Similarly, there were no differences in secondary outcomes. Among HIV-infected pregnant women in the setting of indoor residual spraying of insecticide, adding monthly DP to daily TMP-SMX did not reduce the risk of placental or maternal malaria or improve birth outcomes.

The collaborative African genomics network training program: a trainee perspective on training the next generation of African scientists	GENETICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						African scientists; bioinformatics; genomics research; North-South gap; training model	RESEARCH PARTNERSHIPS	Purpose: The Collaborative African Genomics Network (CAfGEN) aims to establish sustainable genomics research programs in Botswana and Uganda through long-term training of PhD students from these countries at Baylor College of Medicine. Here, we present an overview of the CAfGEN PhD training program alongside-trainees' perspectives on their involvement. Background: Historically, collaborations between high-income countries (HICs) and low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), or North-South collaborations, have been criticized for the lack of a mutually beneficial distribution of resources and research findings, often undermining LMICs. CAfGEN plans to address this imbalance in the genomics field through a program of technology and expertise transfer to the participating LMICs. Methods: An overview of the training program is presented. Trainees from the CAfGEN project summarized their experiences, looking specifically at the training model, benefits of the program, challenges encountered relating to the cultural transition, and program outcomes after the first 2 years. Conclusion: Collaborative training programs like CAfGEN will not only help establish sustainable long-term research initiatives in LMICs but also foster stronger North-South and South-South networks. The CAfGEN model offers a framework for the development of training programs aimed at genomics education for those for whom genomics is not their "first language."

Identification of Acute HIV-1 Infection by Hologic Aptima HIV-1 RNA Qualitative Assay	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						acute HIV-1 infection; Hologic Aptima assay; early HIV-1 infection; HIV-1 RNA	ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; VIRAL LOAD; SET-POINT; RISK; DIAGNOSIS; SYMPTOMS; VIREMIA; PREVENTION; STRATEGIES	The Hologic Aptima HIV-1 Qualitative RNA assay was used in a rigorous screening approach designed to identify individuals at the earliest stage of HIV-1 infection for enrollment into subsequent studies of cellular and viral events in early infection (RV 217/Early Capture HIV Cohort [ECHO] study). Volunteers at high risk for HIV-1 infection were recruited from study sites in Thailand, Tanzania, Uganda, and Kenya with high HIV-1 prevalence rates among the populations examined. Small-volume blood samples were collected by finger stick at twice-weekly intervals and tested with the Aptima assay. Participants with reactive Aptima test results were contacted immediately for entry into a more comprehensive follow-up schedule with frequent blood draws. Evaluation of the Aptima test prior to use in this study showed a detection sensitivity of 5.5 copies/ml (50%), with all major HIV-1 subtypes detected. A total of 54,306 specimens from 1,112 volunteers were examined during the initial study period (August 2009 to November 2010); 27 individuals were identified as converting from uninfected to infected status. A sporadic reactive Aptima signal was observed in HIV-1-infected individuals under antiretroviral therapy. Occasional false-reactive Aptima results in uninfected individuals, or nonreactive results in HIV-1infected individuals not on therapy, were observed and used to calculate assay sensitivity and specificity. The sensitivity and specificity of the Aptima assay were 99.03% and 99.23%, respectively; positive and negative predictive values were 92.01% and 99.91%, respectively. Conversion from HIV-1-uninfected to -infected status was rapid, with no evidence of a prolonged period of intermittent low-level viremia.

Thirty-five fleas, including 28 Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche ), four Pulex irritans (L.), and three Echidnophaga gallinacea (Westwood) from 19 rural dogs from southwestern Uganda were analyzed for the presence of Rickettsia spp. (ompB, gltA, and 17 kDa fragment genes) and Bartonella spp. (rpoB and ITS genes) by PCR. Rickettsial DNA was detected in 27 out of 28 of Ct. felis and in two out of four P. irritans. None of the E. gallinacea specimens harbored Rickettsia DNA. Rickettsia felis was confirmed in 12 Ct. felis and in the two P. irritans specimens with positive PCR-results. In addition, the presence of Candidatus Rickettsia asemboensis was evidenced in 15 Ct. felis. Bartonella spp. was not amplified in any sample. Our survey indicates that R. felis, the agent of the flea-borne spotted fever, is present in the study area. Besides, this is the first description of Ca. R. asemboensis in Uganda.

Little information is known about preference across formulations, especially among product experienced women. Seventy-one women (48% married; median age 26; range 18-45) who were participating in a vaginal ring trial for HIV prevention in Malawi, South Africa, Uganda, and Zimbabwe underwent an in-depth interview at their last study visit, during which they were presented with pictures and descriptions of nine possible product formulations (male and female condoms, oral tablets, injectables, implants, and a vaginal gel, ring, insert, and film). Each formulation was discussed, highlighting salient attribute(s) and contextual factors that may have informed stated preferences. Participants expressed most interest for long-acting PrEP formulations (rings, 94%; implants, 39%; injections, 34%), which were generally favored over short-acting ones. Participants appreciated the continuous protection offered, discreet usage, and the advantage of peace of mind imparted by simplified use and infrequent dosing, alleviating worries around forgetting doses. Preferred attributes of short-acting formulations included reversibility, user control, ease of administration, and low toxicity. Participants were least interested in the oral tablets (due to the daily dosing, difficulty swallowing pills, and HIV-related stigma), and the vaginal gel and film (due to vaginal insertion, coital dosing, effect on sex. and unfamiliarity with the method). Dislike for vaginally administered products was more pronounced among young women. Multiple factors played into potential users' considerations for preferred formulations, emphasizing how a suite of options for prevention might best respond to women's needs and wants.

National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAGs) are established by national authorities to provide them with independent, bias-free, objective, and evidence-based advice on vaccines and immunization challenges. As of December 2015, 125 countries have reported having set up an NITAG. The Health Policy and Institutional Development Center at the Agence de Medecine Preventive, a World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborative Center for evidence-informed immunization, through its Supporting Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees (SIVAC) Initiative project, provides assistance to low-and middle-income countries in the establishment and strengthening of their NITAGs. The Indonesian NITAG (ITAGI) was formed in December 2006 and Uganda's (UNITAG) was formed in November 2014. Both Uganda and Indonesia have introduced inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) as part of the Global Polio Eradication and Endgame Strategic Plan (the Endgame plan). The authors reflect on the process and the role played by NITAGs in the introduction of IPV in the routine immunization program and the lessons learned. Methods. This commentary is a reflection of the authors' experience on NITAG's role as observed in 2 particular local settings and applied to a global public health issue, the polio eradication Endgame plan. The reflection is backed up by the relevant (policy and technical) documents on polio eradication, along with minutes and reports from countries' ministries of health, immunization programs, WHO, and NITAGs. Results. NITAGs are valuable tools for ministries of health to ensure sustainable, evidence-informed immunization policies that are trusted and accepted by their communities. Early engagement with NITAGs also ensures that the adoption of strategies addressing global public health threats at the country level reinforces the national immunization programs. On the other end, when NITAGs are proactive and forward-thinking, they can contribute to a smooth and effective introduction of the above-mentioned strategies. Time and resources are key factors to ensure optimal performance of NITAGs.

Concordance Between Laboratory Diagnosed Sexually Transmitted Infections and Self-Reported Measures of Risky Sex by Partner Type Among Rural Ugandan Outpatients	AIDS AND BEHAVIOR			English	Article						Sexual behavior; Africa; Syphilis; Chlamydia; Gonorrhea	BEHAVIOR; INTERVENTION; CHLAMYDIA	Numerous HIV risk reduction interventions which show effects on sexual risk behaviors fail to find effects on STIs. We examined the concordance between laboratory diagnosed STIs and sexual risk behavior among Ugandan outpatients (n = 328). We screened for STIs and assessed sexual behavior at baseline and 6 month follow-up. Less risk was associated with an STI at baseline. At follow-up more unprotected sex with casual partners was associated with incident Syphilis, more unprotected sex with primary and secondary regular partners was associated with incident Chlamydia or Gonorrhea. Our results suggest ways to improve concordance between behavioral measures and STIs.

Other entities, such as ruptured omphalocele, vanishing gastroschisis, and patent omphalomesenteric ducts with prolapse, have also been described and can create a confusing picture. This case of a newborn with a midline abdominal defect and a mass that was intestine-like and arose from the bowel cannot be classified, and no similar reports were found.

However, existing knowledge of how and why such co-occurrence takes place is limited, particularly in the Global South. The current study aims to advance empirical and conceptual understanding of intersecting IPV and VAC within families in order to inform potential programming. We explore shared perceptions and experiences of IPV and VAC using qualitative data collected in December 2015 from adults and children in Kampala, Uganda (n = 106). We find that the patriarchal family structure creates an environment that normalizes many forms of violence, simultaneously infantilizing women and reinforcing their subordination (alongside children). Based on participant experiences, we identify four potential patterns that suggest how IPV and VAC not only co-occur, but more profoundly intersect within the family, triggering cycles of emotional and physical abuse: bystander trauma, negative role modeling, protection and further victimization, and displaced aggression. The discussion is situated within a feminist analysis, including careful consideration of maternal violence and an emphasis on the ways in which gender and power dynamics can coalesce and contribute to intra-family violence.

Important Plant Areas: revised selection criteria for a global approach to plant conservation	BIODIVERSITY AND CONSERVATION			English	Review						Botanical richness; Complementarity; GSPC; KBA; Prioritisation; Threatened habitat; Threatened species; Useful plants	KEY BIODIVERSITY AREAS; IMPORTANT BIRD AREAS; SYSTEMATIC CONSERVATION; ECOSYSTEM SERVICES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DIVERSITY; TAXON	Despite the severe threats to plant habitats and high levels of extinction risk for plant species in many parts of the world, plant conservation priorities are often poorly represented in national and global frameworks because of a lack of data in an accessible and consistent format to inform conservation decision making. The Important Plant Areas (IPAs) criteria system offers a pragmatic yet scientifically rigorous means of delivering these datasets, enabling informed national- or regional-scale conservation prioritisation, and contributing significantly towards global prioritisation systems including the International Union for Conservation of Nature Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) Standard. In this paper, we review the IPA rationale and progress on IPA identification to date, including the perceived limitations of the process and how these may be overcome. We then present a revised set of criteria for use globally, developed through the combined experiences of IPA identification over the past decade and a half and through a recent global consultation process. An overview of how the revised IPA criteria can work alongside the newly published KBA Standard is also provided. IPA criteria are based around a sound, scientific, global framework which acknowledges the practical problems of gathering plant and habitat data in many regions of the world, and recognises the role of peer reviewed expert opinion in the selection process. National and sub-national engagement in IPA identification is essential, providing a primary route towards long term conservation of key sites for plant diversity. The IPA criteria can be applied to the conservation of all organism groups within the plant and fungal kingdoms.

Feasibility of a streamlined tuberculosis diagnosis and treatment initiation strategy	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TUBERCULOSIS AND LUNG DISEASE			English	Article						tuberculosis; diagnosis; implementation research; Xpert	SPUTUM SMEAR MICROSCOPY; PATIENT; SERVICES; COSTS	OBJECTIVE: To assess the feasibility of a streamlined strategy for improving tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic evaluation and treatment initiation among patients with presumed TB. DESIGN: Single-arm interventional pilot study at five primary care health centers of a streamlined, SinglesaMPLE (SIMPLE) TB diagnostic evaluation strategy: 1) examination of two smear results from a single spot sputum specimen using light-emitting diode fluorescence microscopy, and 2) daily transportation of smear negative sputum samples to Xpert MTB/RIF testing sites. RESULTS: Of 1212 adults who underwent sputum testing for TB, 99.6% had two smears examined from the spot sputum specimen. Sputum was transported for Xpert testing within 1 clinic day for 83% (907/1091) of the smear-negative patients. Of 157 (13%) patients with bacteriologically positive TB, 116 (74%) were identified using sputum smear microscopy and 41 (26%) using Xpert testing of smear-negative samples. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was initiated in 142 (90%) patients with bacteriologically positive TB, with a median time to treatment of 1 day for smear-positive patients and 6 days for smear-negative, Xpert-positive patients. CONCLUSION: The SIMPLE TB strategy led to successful incorporation of Xpert testing and rapid treatment initiation in the majority of patients with bacteriologically confirmed TB in a resource-limited setting.

Surgical Care Capacity in Uganda: Government Versus Private Sector Investment	INTERNATIONAL SURGERY			English	Article						Surgery; Anesthesia; Obstetrics; Uganda; Oxygen; District hospital	EMERGENCY	Background: Uganda is a low-income country with blended, tiered government health care facilities and private/non-governmental (NGO)/mission hospitals. The population is 84% rural; 100% of referral hospitals and majority of specialist physicians are urban. Summary of background data: This project compared various levels of government hospitals with private/NGO hospitals to determine adequacy to deliver emergency and essential surgical care (EESC) and anesthesia. Methods: Using the WHO Situational Analysis Tool, a representative selection of 38 hospitals (25% of Ugandan hospitals) was assessed for capacity to deliver surgical, anesthetic and obstetric care in 4 domains: infrastructure, human resources, surgeries performed or referred, and equipment. Results: In all facilities, laboratory availability was 86%; anesthesia machines, 66%; generators, 55%; and continuous running water, 42%; oxygen, 32%; and electricity, 26%. Resuscitator bags and mask/tubing were present less than 50% of health facilities. Only 84% of all health facilities had a stethoscope; sterilizers only at 50%. This situation was much more dismal in district hospitals. Surgeons were found at 71% of public hospitals and 63% of NGO/mission hospitals; 60% surgeons, and over 50% of anesthesiologists were only in teaching hospitals; obstetricians almost exclusively in higher-level hospitals. Conclusions: The infrastructure for surgical services and anesthesia were noticeably absent at district hospital level and below, yet were readily available at the tertiary care center level. Overall national and regional referral hospitals were better equipped than NGO facilities, suggesting the government is capable of fully equipping hospitals to provide surgical care. These surveys highlight potential for improvement in surgical care at all levels.

A Closer Look at Explanatory Models Among Clinical and Nonclinical Samples in Uganda	JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						depression; help seeking; explanatory models; cultural competence; psychotherapy	HELP-SEEKING BEHAVIOR; MENTAL-HEALTH; AMERICAN WOMEN; ILLNESS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PERCEPTIONS; PREVALENCE; PEOPLE	Objective: Explanatory models (EMs) are a collection of beliefs about a disorder that can help us understand help-seeking and treatment pathways in diverse contexts. In 2 related studies, we explore EMs about depression held among both clinical and nonclinical samples in Uganda. To explore the potential of EMs to predict help seeking, we assessed the relationship between 2 main aspects of the EM: problem conceptualization and treatment. Method: In Study 1, we interviewed and assessed EMs of depression for 135 lay community members and 111 professional practitioners using a vignette. In Study 2, we assessed actual EMs among 33 clinically depressed adults. We transcribed all interviews and analyzed and coded the content. In Study 1, we used logistic regression to examine the relationship of problem conceptualization and stigma to treatment choice; in Study 2, we used Fisher's exact tests to examine the relationship between conceptualization and treatment. Sociodemographics such as age, income, and language were also examined. Results: Interviews elicited a diverse range of beliefs about the nature of depression and the types of treatment needed. However, problem conceptualization did not predict treatment in either group. Instead, education and interview language predicted treatment in clinical and nonclinical samples. Conclusion: Although EMs can be useful for both exploring mental health and treatment-related beliefs in clinical settings and developing mental health services, contextual factors may be more significant predictors of help seeking.

Here, in the International Congestive Heart Failure (INTER-CHF) study, we aimed to measure mortality at 1 year in patients with heart failure in Africa, China, India, the Middle East, southeast Asia and South America; we also explored demographic, clinical, and socioeconomic variables associated with mortality. Methods We enrolled consecutive patients with heart failure (3695 [66%] clinic outpatients, 2105 [34%] hospital in patients) from 108 centres in six geographical regions. We recorded baseline demographic and clinical characteristics and followed up patients at 6 months and 1 year from enrolment to record symptoms, medications, and outcomes. Time to death was studied with Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for demographic and clinical variables, medications, socioeconomic variables, and region. We used the explained risk statistic to calculate the relative contribution of each level of adjustment to the risk of death. Findings We enrolled 5823 patients within 1 year (with 98% follow-up). Overall mortality was 16.5%: highest in Africa (34%) and India (23%), intermediate in southeast Asia (15%), and lowest in China (7%), South America (9%), and the Middle East (9%). Regional differences persisted after multivariable adjustment. Independent predictors of mortality included cardiac variables (New York Heart Association Functional Class III or IV, previous admission for heart failure, and valve disease) and non-cardiac variables (body-mass index, chronic kidney disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease). 46% of mortality risk was explained by multivariable modelling with these variables; however, the remainder was unexplained. Interpretation Marked regional differences in mortality in patients with heart failure persisted after multivariable adjustment for cardiac and non-cardiac factors. Therefore, variations in mortality between regions could be the result of health-care infrastructure, quality and access, or environmental and genetic factors. Further studies in large, global cohorts are needed. Funding The study was supported by Novartis. Copyright (C) The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells are a Potential Reservoir for Ebola Virus in the Human Eye	TRANSLATIONAL VISION SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Ebola virus; human; eye; infection; pigment epithelial cell	T-CELLS; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; RELATIVE QUANTIFICATION; LYMPHOCYTE APOPTOSIS; HEMORRHAGIC-FEVER; IMMUNE PRIVILEGE; DENDRITIC CELLS; MARBURG VIRUS; GROWTH-FACTOR; SIERRA-LEONE	Purpose: Success of Ebola virus (EBOV) as a human pathogen relates at the molecular level primarily to blockade the host cell type I interferon (IFN) antiviral response. Most individuals who survive Ebola virus disease (EVD) develop a chronic disease syndrome: approximately one-quarter of survivors suffer from uveitis, which has been associated with presence of EBOV within the eye. Clinical observations of post-Ebola uveitis indicate involvement of retinal pigment epithelial cells. Methods: We inoculated ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells with EBOV, and followed course of infection by immunocytochemistry and measurement of titer in culture supernatant. To interrogate transcriptional responses of infected cells, we combined RNA sequencing with in silico pathway, gene ontology, transcription factor binding site, and network analyses. We measured infection-induced changes of selected transcripts by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Results: Human retinal pigment epithelial cells were permissive to infection with EBOV, and supported viral replication and release of virus in high titer. Unexpectedly, 28% of 560 upregulated transcripts in EBOV-infected cells were type I IFN responsive, indicating a robust type I IFN response. Following EBOV infection, cells continued to express multiple immunomodulatory molecules linked to ocular immune privilege. Conclusions: Human retinal pigment epithelial cells may serve as an intraocular reservoir for EBOV, and the molecular response of infected cells may contribute to the persistence of live EBOV within the human eye. Translational Relevance: This bedside-to-bench research links ophthalmic findings in survivors of EVD who suffer from uveitis with interactions between retinal pigment epithelial cells and EBOV.

Few dated phylogenetic/phylogeographic analyses are however available. Here, we address the hypotheses that the sub-Saharan African sweet vernal grasses have a dual colonization history and that lineages of independent origins have established secondary contact. We carried out rangewide sampling across the eastern African high mountains, inferred dated phylogenies from nuclear ribosomal and plastid DNA using Bayesian methods, and performed flow cytometry and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) analyses. We inferred a single Late Pliocene western Eurasian origin of the eastern African taxa, whose high-ploid populations in one mountain group formed a distinct phylogeographic group and carried plastids that diverged from those of the currently allopatric southern African lineage in the Mid-to Late Pleistocene. We show that Anthoxanthum has an intriguing history in sub-Saharan Africa, including Late Pliocene colonization from southeast and north, followed by secondary contact, hybridization, allopolyploidization and local extinction during one of the last glacial cycles. Our results add to a growing body of evidence showing that isolated tropical high mountain habitats have a dynamic recent history involving niche conservatism and recruitment from remote sources, repeated dispersals, diversification, hybridization and local extinction.

However, less is known about the role of central nervous system (CNS) TNF-alpha in CM. We assessed plasma (n=249) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (n=167) TNF-alpha levels in Ugandan children with CM, plasma TNF-alpha in Ugandan community control children (n=198) and CSF TNF-alpha in North American control children who had recovered from leukaemia (n=13). Plasma and CSF TNF-alpha were measured by magnetic bead assay. We compared plasma and CSF TNF-alpha levels in children with CM to mortality, acute and chronic neurologic deficits and long-term neurocognitive impairment. Plasma and CSF TNF-alpha levels were higher in CM than control children (P<.0001 for both). CSF TNF-alpha levels were higher in children who had neurologic deficits at discharge or 6-month follow-up (P <=.05 for both). Elevated CSF but not plasma TNF-alpha was associated with longer coma duration (Spearman's rho .18, P=.02) and deficits in overall cognition in children 5 years and older (beta coefficient -.74, 95% CI -1.35 to -0.13, P=.02). The study findings suggest that CNS TNF-alpha may be involved in the development of acute and chronic neurologic and cognitive sequelae in children with CM.	[Shabani, E.; John, C.

Social network characteristics and resource access among formerly displaced households in Lira, Uganda	DISASTERS			English	Article						livelihoods; northern Uganda; post conflict; social networks	SUPPORT NETWORKS; CRISIS; WOMEN	In rural African communities, the support of extended family, friends, and neighbours is essential in borrowing or leveraging land, labour, food, and money, especially at times of social and financial turmoil. Little is known, though, about the nature of the networks and the conditions under which they may generate greater support in post-conflict communities. This study, conducted in the Lira district of northern Uganda, examined the composition, proximity, and size of the networks that households utilise to gain access to resources during and after resettlement. Network structures with more kin and co-resident ties were found to offer greater resource access to households in post-conflict settings. Furthermore, there was a lack of meaningful linkages outside of a person's own village, especially with regard to households whose head has no or a low level of education. These findings enhance understanding of the specific role of relationships in social support for resource access among households in post-conflict communities.

Recent findings The Encore-1 study, followed by a detailed pharmacokinetic analysis of efavirenz 400 versus 600 mg once daily, produced enough information for the most recent ARV treatment WHO guidelines to include efavirenz 400 mg among agents used for first-line treatment. However, data on efavirenz 400 mg plasma concentrations during pregnancy and when coadministered with rifampicin-containing antituberculosis (TB) treatment are not yet available as formal pharmacokinetic studies under these circumstances are ongoing. Summary Although efavirenz at a daily dose of 400 mg once daily in combination with tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine has shown noninferiority to the approved 600 mg once-daily dose, large global uptake has been delayed by the lack of data on drug exposure during pregnancy and anti-TB treatment. Knowledge on efavirenz 400 mg exposure in these scenarios will arise in mid-late 2017.

The blood-sucking lice are obligate, host-specific parasites of mammals and are themselves host to symbiotic bacteria. In human lice, these bacterial symbionts supply the lice with B-vitamins. Here, we sequenced the genomes of symbiotic and heritable bacterial of human, chimpanzee, gorilla, and monkey lice and used phylogenomics to investigate their evolutionary relationships. We find that these symbionts have a phylogenetic history reflecting the louse phylogeny, a finding contrary to previous reports of symbiont replacement. Examination of the highly reduced symbiont genomes (0.53-0.57 Mb) reveals much of the genomes are dedicated to vitamin synthesis. This is unchanged in the smallest symbiont genome and one that appears to have been reorganized. Specifically, symbionts from human lice, chimpanzee lice, and gorilla lice carry a small plasmid that encodes synthesis of vitamin B5, a vitamin critical to the bacteria-louse symbiosis. This plasmid is absent in an old world monkey louse symbiont, where this pathway is on its primary chromosome. This suggests the unique genomic configuration brought about by the plasmid is not essential for symbiosis, but once obtained, it has persisted for up to 25 My. We also find evidence that human, chimpanzee, and gorilla louse endosymbionts have lost a pathway for synthesis of vitamin B1, whereas the monkey louse symbiont has retained this pathway. It is unclear whether these changes are adaptive, but they may point to evolutionary responses of louse symbionts to shifts in primate biology.

J	Lederer, J; Ogwang, F; Karungi, J				Lederer, Jakob; Ogwang, Francis; Karungi, Jeninah			Knowledge identification and creation among local stakeholders in CDM waste composting projects: A case study from Uganda	RESOURCES CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING			English	Article						CDM; Composting; Stakeholders; Action research; Material flow analysis; Africa	CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM; MUNICIPAL SOLID-WASTE; DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES; MANAGEMENT PROJECTS; FARMING SYSTEMS; CARBON MARKETS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AFRICA; MINIMIZATION; INDONESIA	Municipal solid waste composting is seen as a promising technology in Sub-Saharan Africa to offset greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) program. The main reasons given therefore are the large organic fraction in municipal solid waste in this world region and the low complexity of the technology. The investigation results of case studies from other world regions suggest that the knowledge of local stakeholders involved in CDM composting projects is another crucial factor for their success and sustainability. The existing knowledge and knowledge demand of these stakeholders, however, is rarely considered in CDM composting project design documents from Sub-Saharan Africa. The study presented in the article at hand aimed to investigate both the existing knowledge and knowledge gaps of local stakeholders in a CDM waste composting project implemented in 17 cities in the Sub-Saharan African country of Uganda. This was done by selecting one of these cities (Busia) as a case study. After identifying the most important local stakeholders, methods of data collection and analysis (i.e. interviews, focus group discussions, compost field tests, material flow analysis, and full cost accounting) were embedded in an action research framework and applied to the case study of Busia prior to implementation of the CDM project. Furthermore, ways of closing the knowledge gaps identified were elaborated. Results showed that city authorities implementing and operating the CDM composting project, as well as farmers as potential users of the compost, were the two most relevant stakeholder groups. For city authorities, a knowledge gap regarding the net costs and benefits associated with the CDM project was identified, due to the underestimation of operation costs for composting and the overestimation of revenues from compost sales in the CDM project design document. The overestimation of compost sales revenues was due to the non-existence of a compost market, explained by the lack of experience and knowledge of farmers with respect to compost use and its value. While this knowledge among farmers can be acquired, for instance by means of agricultural extension services, key factors for marketing the compost, such as appropriate compost prices and compost quality, must also be addressed as part of a comprehensive solution. Investigations like the one presented in the article at hand are important not only for future CDM composting projects in Sub-Saharan African countries, but also for designing greenhouse gas mitigation programs under the green climate fund in the post-CDM period, as stipulated in the Paris Convention of Parties 21 Agreement.

Hazardous alcohol consumption is not associated with CD4+T-cell count decline among PLHIV in Kampala Uganda: A prospective cohort study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HIV DISEASE PROGRESSION; ANTIRETROVIRAL ADHERENCE; USE DISORDERS; INFECTION; IMMUNODEFICIENCY; METAANALYSIS; INDIVIDUALS; THERAPY; HEALTH; IMPACT	Introduction There is limited data on the effects of alcohol on immunological response among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) in sub-Saharan Africa. We assessed the relationship between hazardous alcohol use and CD4+ T-cell count, among PLHIV in Uganda. Methods PLHIV aged >= 18 years were enrolled in a cohort study at the Infectious diseases clinic Kampala, Uganda. Alcohol consumption was assessed at enrolment (baseline) and 6 monthly thereafter using the alcohol use disorders identification test (AUDIT). The CD4+ T-cell counts, assessed at baseline and over the next 12 months were compared between alcohol use strata, using linear mixed effects regression. Using longitudinal mediation analysis methods, we estimated the effect of alcohol induced ART non-adherence on CD4+ T-cell count. Results Of the 1566 participants enrolled, 863(44.1%) were non-alcohol users (AUDIT score = 0), 433(27.7%) were non-hazardous (AUDIT score 1 - 7) alcohol users while 270 (17.2%) were hazardous (AUDIT score >= 8) alcohol users. The overall median (IQR) baseline CD4+ T-cell count was 356 (243 - 516) cells/mu l. There were no differences in the median baseline CD4+ T-cell count between hazardous and nonhazardous alcohol users compared to non-alcohol users in both the non-ART (p = 0.43) and ART group (p = 0.77). The mean CD4+ T-cell count over 12 months was not different between hazardous alcohol users and non-alcohol users (non-ART group p = 0.88 and ART group p = 0.62), nor between non-hazardous alcohol users and non-alcohol users (and non-ART group p = 0.66 and ART group p = 0.20). Alcohol use was not associated with a significant natural direct effect on CD4(+) T-cell count (1.37 95% CI [-1.78, 4.52] cells/mu l, p = 0.39) but had a statistically significant natural indirect effect on reduction of CD4(+) T-cell count (-0.91 cells/mu l [-1.36, -0.45], p < 0.001) mediated through ART non-adherence. Conclusion Hazardous alcohol use among PLHIV was not directly associated with lower CD4+ T-cell count but had a significant natural indirect effect on CD4+ T-cell count mediated through ART non-adherence. Among PLHIV with lower than expected CD4+ T-cell count, alcohol consumption should be excluded as an underlying factor for non-adherence to ART and any interventions targeting alcohol use should tackle possible ART non-adherence.

Methods and Results: The AIDS response has seen remarkable achievements in scientific advances, in translation of those advances into prevention, treatment and care for affected individuals and communities, and in large scale implementation reaching 18 million people with antiviral therapy by mid-year 2016. Yet incident HIV infections in adults remain stubbornly stable and are increasing in some regions and among adolescents and adults in some key populations, challenging current science, policy and programming. There have been important advances in both preventive vaccines and in cure research, but both areas require ongoing investment and innovation. Clinical research has flourished with new agents, regimens, delivery modes and diagnostics but has been challenged by aging and increasingly complex patient populations, long-term adherence challenges, co-infections and co-morbidities, and unresolved issues in TB management and epidemic control. It is an extraordinary period of innovation in prevention, yet the promise of new tools and combination approaches have yet to deliver epidemic HIV control. Conclusions: Proven interventions, most notably pre-exposure prophylaxis, PrEP, have been limited in rollout and impact. Treatment as prevention has the promise to improve clinical outcomes but remains uncertain as a prevention tool to reduce population-level HIV incidence. The improvement of legal, policy and human rights environments for those most at risk for HIV acquisition and most at risk for lack of access to essential services; sexual and gender minorities, sex workers of all genders, people who inject drugs, and prisoners and detainees remain among the greatest unmet needs in HIV/AIDS. Failure to do better for these individuals and communities could undermine the HIV response.

In Burkina Faso, it is not uncommon for mothers to drink alcohol, even during pregnancy. We aimed to study the association between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and the child's cognitive performance using the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (KABC-II) and the Children's Category Test Level 1 (CCT-1) in rural Burkina Faso. Methods. We conducted a follow-up study of a community cluster-randomised Exclusive breastfeeding trial, and re-enrolled the children in rural Burkina Faso. A total of 518 children (268 boys and 250 girls) aged 6-8 years were assessed using the KABC-II and the CCT-1. We examined the effect size difference using Cohen's d and conducted a linear regression analysis to examine the association. Results. Self-reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy was 18.5% (96/518). Children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy performed significantly poorly for memory and spatial abilities tests from small effect size difference for 'Atlantis' (0.27) and 'Triangle' (0.29) to moderate effect size difference for 'Number recall' (0.72) compared to children whose mothers did not consume alcohol during pregnancy; the exposed children scored significantly higher errors with a small effect size (0.37) at problem solving (CCT-1) test compared to unexposed children. At unstandardized and standardized multivariable analysis, children whose mothers reported alcohol consumption during pregnancy performed significantly poorer for memory- 'Atlantis' (p = 0.03) and 'Number recall' (p = 0.0001), and spatial ability tests- 'Triangle' (p = 0.03); they scored significantly higher errors at problem solving CCT-1 test (p = 0.002); all the results were adjusted for age, sex, schooling, stunting, father's education, mother's employment and the promotion of exclusive breastfeeding. No statistical association was found for visual abilities- 'Conceptual Thinking', 'Face recognition', 'Story completion', and reasoning tests- 'Rover', 'Block counting', and 'Pattern Reasoning'. Conclusion. Maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy is associated with poorer cognitive performance for memory, spatial ability, and problem solving tests in the offspring in rural Burkina Faso. Futures studies needs to assess in more detail the maternal alcohol consumption patterns in Burkina Faso and possible preventive strategies.

Results: Morbidity of ten pigs with high sand flea intensities detected during high transmission seasons in an endemic area in Busoga sub region, Uganda is described in detail. The cases of pigs presented with a very high number of embedded sand fleas (median = 276, range = 141-838). Acute manifestations due to severe tungiasis included ulcerations (n = 10), abscess formation (n = 6) and lameness (n = 9). Chronic morphopathological presentations were overgrowth of claws (n = 5), lateral deviation of dew claws (n = 6), detachment (n = 5) or loss of dew claws (n = 1). Treatment of severe cases with a topical insecticidal aerosol containing chlorfenvinphos, dichlorvos and gentian violet resolved acute morbidity and facilitated healing by re-epithelialisation. Conclusions: The presentations of tungiasis highlighted in this report show that high intensities of embedded T. penetrans can cause a severe clinical disease in pigs. Effective tungiasis preventive measures and early diagnosis for treatment could be crucial to minimize its effects on animal health.

This approach entails the initiation of lifelong antiretroviral therapy in all HIV positive pregnant women, also implying protection during breastfeeding for 12 months or longer. Research on long-term adherence to Option B+ throughout breastfeeding is scarce to date. Therefore, we conducted a prospective observational cohort study in Fort Portal, Western Uganda, to assess adherence to Option B+ until 18 months postpartum. In 2013, we recruited 67 HIV-positive, Option B+ enrolled women six weeks after giving birth and scheduled them for follow-up study visits after six, twelve and 18 months. Two adherence measures, self-reported drug intake and amount of drug refill visits, were combined to define adherence, and were assessed together with feeding information at all study visits. At six months postpartum, 51% of the enrolled women were considered to be adherent. Until twelve and 18 months postpartum, adherence for the respective follow-up interval decreased to 19% and 20.5% respectively. No woman was completely adherent until 18 months. At the same time, 76.5% of the women breastfed for >= 12 months. Drug adherence was associated with younger age (p<0.01), lower travel costs (p = 0.02), and lower number of previous deliveries (p = 0.04). Long-term adherence to Option B+ seems to be challenging. Considering that in our cohort, prolonged breastfeeding until >= 12 months was widely applied while postpartum adherence until the end of breastfeeding was poor, a potential risk of postpartum vertical transmission needs to be taken seriously into account for Option B+ implementation.

We compared HIV disease parameters among women who seroconverted while receiving tenofovir-containing oral or vaginal pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to placebo. Methods Participants with HIV seroconversion in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of oral tenofovir, oral tenofovir/emtricitabine, and vaginal tenofovir gel (MTN-003) were followed in a longitudinal cohort study (MTN-015). The effect of oral and vaginal tenofovir-containing PrEP on HIV disease progression was compared to placebo using linear mixed effects and Cox proportional hazard models, as appropriate. Additional analyses were performed to compare the outcomes among participants with detectable tenofovir or emtricitabine in plasma at the first quarterly visit in MTN-003. Results A total of 224 participants were included in the analysis; 93% from South Africa and 94% clade C virus. No differences in HIV RNA at steady state or the trajectory over 12 months were observed for each active arm compared to placebo; tenofovir gel recipients had higher CD4(+) T cell counts (722 vs 596 cells/mm(3); p = 0.02) at 90 days after estimated HIV seroconversion and higher average rates of change over 12 months compared to placebo (-181 vs -92 cells/mm(3) per year; p = 0.08). With a median follow-up of 31 months, no significant differences were observed for time to CD4(+) T cell count <= 350 cells/mm(3), or the composite endpoint of CD4(+) T cells <= 350 cells/mm(3), initiation of antiretroviral therapy or death for each active arm compared to placebo. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the HIV RNA or CD4+ T cell counts at baseline, the change to month 12, or any disease progression outcomes among participants with oral drug detected and no oral drug detected compared to placebo. Conclusions No clinically significant differences in HIV seroconversion outcomes were observed among women randomized to tenofovir-containing oral or vaginal PrEP regimens, however low overall adherence limits the generalizability of these findings.

Here, we explore the possible benefits and risks of implementing universal ART for all HIV-infected children and adolescents and outline some of the key considerations that led to the 2016 revision of WHO guidelines. Methods: We conducted a review of the published data from 2000 to 2016, to ascertain the clinical and programmatic benefits, as well as the risks of implementing universal ART for all children. Results and discussion: Universal ART for all children has the potential to increase treatment coverage, which in 2015 was only 51% globally, as well as providing several biological benefits, by preventing: premature death/loss to follow-up, progressive destruction of the immune system, poor growth and pubertal delay, poor neuro-cognitive outcomes and future burden to the health care system with complications of untreated HIV-infection. However, the strategy could be associated with risks, notably development of HIV drug resistance, antiretroviral drug toxicities and increased costs to an already stretched health system. Conclusion: Overall, our findings suggest that the benefits could outweigh the risks and support universal ART for all HIV-infected children, but recognize that national programmes will need to put measures in place to minimize the risks if they choose to implement the strategy.

The study employed Peer Family Planning Champions to offer health education, counselling, and triage aimed at increasing the identification, referral and family planning (FP) uptake among HIV positive mothers attending the clinic. Methods: The Peer Champion Intervention to improve FP uptake was introduced into Mulago Hospital PMTCT/PNC clinic, Kampala Uganda. During the intervention period, peers provided additional FP counselling and education; assisted in identification and referral of HIV Positive mothers in need of FP services; and accompanied referred mothers to FP clinics. We compiled and compared the average proportions of mothers in need that were referred and took up FP in the pre-intervention (3 months), intervention (6 months), and post-intervention(3 months) periods using interrupted time series with segmented regression models with an autoregressive term of one. Results: Overall, during the intervention, the proportion of referred mothers in need of FP increased by 30.4 percentage points (P < 0.001), from 52.7 to 83.2 percentage points. FP uptake among mothers in need increased by over 31 percentage points (P < 0.001) from 47.2 to 78.5 percentage points during the intervention. There was a positive non-significant change in the weekly trend of referral beta(3) = 2.9 percentage points (P = 0.077) and uptake beta(3) = 1.9 percentage points (P = 0.176) during the intervention as compared to the pre-intervention but this was reversed during the post intervention. Over 57% (2494) mothers took up Depo-Provera injectable-FP method during the study. Conclusions: To support overstrained health care work force in post-natal clinics, peers in trained effective family planning can be a valuable addition to clinic staff in limited-resource settings. The study provides additional evidence on the utilization of peer mothers in HIV care, improves health services uptake including family planning which is a common practice in many donor supported programs. It also provides evidence that may be used to advocate for policy revisions in low-income countries to include peers as support staff especially in busy clinic settings with poor services uptake.

In developing countries it presents as epidemic, in 2014 Hepatitis E Virus (HEV) outbreak was reported in Napak district Uganda. The role of factors in this setting that might have propagated this HEV epidemic, including host, agent, and environmental characteristics, were still not clear. This study was therefore conducted to investigate the risk factors, person, place and time characteristics, associated with the hepatitis E virus (HEV) epidemic in Napak district. Methods: Review of line lists data for epidemiological description and matched case control study on neighborhood and age in the ratio of 1:2 were used to assess risk factors for HEV outbreak in Napak. Cluster and random sampling were used to obtain a sample size of 332, (111 cases, 221 controls). Possible interaction and confounding was assessed using conditional logistic regression. Results: Over 1359 cases and 30 deaths were reported during 2013/2014 HEV outbreak. The mean age of patients was 29 +/- years, 57.9% of cases were females. Overall case Fatality Ratio was 2.2% in general population but 65.2% in pregnant women. More than 94% of the cases were reported in the sub counties of Napak, 5.7% of cases were reported in the outside neighboring districts. The epidemic peaked in January 2014 and gradually subsided by December 2014. Risk factors found to be associated with HEV included drinking untreated water (OR 6.69, 95% CI 3.15-14.16), eating roadside food (OR 6.11, 95% CI 2.85-13.09), reported not cleaning utensils (OR 3.24, 95% CI 1.55-1.76), and being a hunter (OR 1.14, 95% CI 1.03-12.66). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the virus is transmitted by the feco-oral route through contaminated water. They also suggest that active surveillance and appropriate measures targeting community and routine individual health actions are important to prevent transmission and decrease the deaths.

To investigate possible interspecies transmission of RVAs, whole genomes of 18 human and 6 domestic animal RVA strains identified in Uganda between 2012 and 2014 were sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The backbone of the human RVA strains had either a Wa - or a DS-1-like genetic constellation. One human strain was a Wa-like mono-reassortant containing a DS-1-like VP2 gene of possible animal origin. All eleven genes of one bovine RVA strain were closely related to those of human RVAs. One caprine strain had a mixed genotype backbone, suggesting that it emerged from multiple reassortment events involving different host species. The porcine RVA strains had mixed genotype backbones with possible multiple reassortant events with strains of human and bovine origin. Overall, whole genome characterisation of rotaviruses found in domestic animals in Uganda strongly suggested the presence of human-to animal RVA transmission, with concomitant circulation of multi-reassortant strains potentially derived from complex interspecies transmission events. However, whole genome data from the human RVA strains causing moderate and severe diarrhoea in under-fives in Uganda indicated that they were primarily transmitted from person-to-person.

Tuberculosis treatment success among rural and urban Ugandans living with HIV: a retrospective study	PUBLIC HEALTH ACTION			English	Article						hospital records; rural; urban; Uganda; PLHIV; TB	CONTROL PROGRAM; BARRIERS; DISTRICT; TB	Setting: Government health centres and hospitals (six urban and 20 rural) providing tuberculosis (TB) treatment for people living with the human immunodeficiency virus (PLHIV) in central and western Uganda. Objective: To identify and quantify modifiable factors that limit TB treatment success among PLHIV in rural Uganda. Design: A retrospective cross-sectional review of routine Uganda National Tuberculosis and Leprosy Programme clinic registers and patient files of HIV-positive patients who received anti-tuberculosis treatment in 2014. Results: Of 191 rural patients, 66.7% achieved treatment success compared to 81.1% of 213 urban patients. Adjusted analysis revealed higher average treatment success in urban patients than in rural patients (OR 3.95, 95%CI 2.70-5.78, P < 0.01, generalised estimating equation model). Loss to follow-up was higher and follow-up sputum smear results were less frequently recorded in TB clinic registers among rural patients. Patients receiving treatment at higher-level facilities in rural settings had greater odds of treatment success, while patients receiving treatment at facilities where drug stock-outs had occurred had lower odds of treatment success. Conclusion: Lower reported treatment success in rural settings is mainly attributed to clinic-centred factors such as treatment monitoring procedures. We recommend strengthening treatment monitoring and delivery.	[Musaazi, J.; Kiragga, A.

Here, we compared hunting and meat-eating behaviour in two adjacent chimpanzee communities (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii) of Budongo Forest, Uganda: the Waibira and Sonso communities. We observed consistent between-group differences in prey-species preferences and in post-hunting behaviour. Sonso chimpanzees show a strong prey preference for Guereza colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza occidentalis; 74.9% hunts), and hunt regularly (1-2 times a month) but with large year-to-year and month-to-month variation. Waibira chimpanzee prey preferences are distributed across primate and duiker species, and resemble those described in an early study of Sonso hunting. Waibira chimpanzees (which include ex-Sonso immigrants) have been observed to feed on red duiker (Cephalophus natalensis; 25%, 9/36 hunts), a species Sonso has never been recorded to feed on (18 years data, 27 years observations), despite no apparent differences in prey distribution; and show less rank-related harassment of meat possessors. We discuss the two most likely and probably interrelated explanations for the observed intergroup variation in chimpanzee hunting behaviour, that is, long-term disruption of complex group-level behaviour due to human presence and possible socially transmitted differences in prey preferences.

Two distinct species of the genus Ipomovirus (family Potyviridae) cause the disease: Cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) and Ugandan cassava brown streak virus (UCBSV). To understand the evolutionary relationships among the viruses, 64 nucleotide sequences from the variable P1 gene from major cassava producing areas of east and central-southern Africa were determined. Methods: We sequenced an amplicon of the P1 region of 31 isolates from Malawi and Tanzania. In addition to these, 33 previously reported sequences of virus isolates from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi and Mozambique were added to the analysis. Results: Phylogenetic analyses revealed three major P1 clades of Cassava brown streak viruses (CBSVs): in addition to a clade of most CBSV and a clade containing all UCBSV, a novel, intermediate clade of CBSV isolates which has been tentatively called CBSV-Tanzania (CBSV-TZ). Virus isolates of the distinctive CBSV-TZ had nucleotide identities as low as 63.2 and 63.7% with other members of CBSV and UCBSV respectively. Conclusions: Grouping of P1 gene sequences indicated for distinct sub-populations of CBSV, but not UCBSV. Representatives of all three clades were found in both Tanzania and Malawi.

In the era of test-and-start, little is known about treatment outcomes and time to undetectable viral loads. This study compares treatment outcomes, median times to achieve undetectable viral loads and its predictors under different antiretroviral (ART) treatment initiation schedules (i.e. within seven days of enrolment or later). Methods: A retrospective cohort of 367 patients < 18 years who enrolled in care between January 2010 and December 2015 with a baseline viral load of > 5000 copies/ml were followed up for 60 months. Undetectable viral load measurements were based on both Roche (< 20copies/ml) and Abbot (< 75copies/ml). Clinical treatment outcomes were compared using chi-squared test. Survival experiences between the two cohorts were assessed through incidence rates and Kaplan Meier curves. A cox model with competing risks was used to assess predictors for time to undetectable viral load. Results: Of the 367 patients, 180 (49.1%) initiated ART within seven days from enrolment, 192 (52.3%) attained undetectable viral load of which 133 (69.3%) were children below six years and 101 (52.6%) were females. Among those who initiated ART within seven days 15 (8.3%) died and 6 (3.3%) were lost to follow-up compared to 27 (14. 4%) and 16 (8.6%) respectively in the later initiators. The median time to undetectable viral load was 24.9 months (95% CI: 19.7, 28.5) among early ART initiators and 38.5 months (95% CI: 31.1, 44.5) among those initiating beyond seven days. There was a significant difference in failure estimates between those initiating within seven and those that deferred (log rank, p = 0.001). Significant predictors for time to undetectable viral load were; starting ART within seven days (SHR = 2.02, 95% CI: 1.24, 3.28), baseline WHO stage I or II (SHR = 1.59, 95% CI: 1.06, 2.28), inconsistent adherence on three consecutive clinic visits (SHR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.67), and baseline weight (SRH = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.07). Conclusion: Prompt initiation of ART within the first week of enrolment is associated with better treatment outcomes. Early timing, baseline WHO clinical stage and adherence rates should be major considerations while managing HIV among children.

An exploratory study of men's companionship, perceptions and experiences during pregnancy and delivery in Uganda	BMC PREGNANCY AND CHILDBIRTH			English	Article						Companionship during delivery; Men's involvement; Uganda		Background: Globally, low involvement of men in maternal health care services remains a problem to health care providers and policy makers. Men's support is essential for making women's world better. There are increasing debates among policymakers and researchers on the role of men in maternal health programs, which is a challenge in patriarchal societies like Uganda. The aim of the study was to assess companionship during delivery; men's perception and experiences during pregnancy and delivery. Methods: This was a descriptive exploratory study using a qualitative approach. This study involved 16 male participants who were present in the labor room during the delivery of their child. In-depth interviews (IDIs) were the main data collection methods used in the study. Purposive sampling was used to select participants who share particular characteristics with the potential of providing rich, relevant, and diverse data. The interviews were tape-recorded with the permission of the participants; in addition, the interviewer took notes. Each interview lasted between 30 and 45 min. The transcripts were entered into ATLAS. ti for analysis. Manifest content analysis was used. Results: The major themes were; feelings about attending child birth, responsibilities during child birth, positive experiences and negative experiences about child birth. Men are willing to participate in child birth and should be encouraged as many are the decision makers in the family. Admission of men into the delivery room, improves family togetherness. The women felt loved and treasured. The men reported bondage to their partners and new born. Conclusions: Men's involvement in the child birth process was associated with a more perceived bondage with the partner and the newborn. Their presence helped to promote a calm and successful child birth process. Hospitals should work on measures encouraging male involvement.	[Lwanga, H.; Sempewo, H.; Lumala, A.; Byaruhanga, R. N.

The lack of standardised dietary tools and their related research support infrastructure remains a major obstacle to implement concerted and region-specific research and action plans worldwide. Citing the magnitude and importance of this challenge, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC/WHO) launched the "Global Nutrition Surveillance initiative" to pilot test the use of a standardized 24-h dietary recall research tool (GloboDiet), validated in Europe, in other regions. In this regard, the development of the GloboDiet-Africa can be optimised by better understanding of the local specific methodological needs, barriers and opportunities. The study aimed to evaluate the standardized 24-h dietary recall research tool (GloboDiet) as a possible common methodology for research and surveillance across Africa. Methods: A consultative panel of African and international experts in dietary assessment participated in six e-workshop sessions. They completed an in-depth e-questionnaire to evaluate the GloboDiet dietary methodology before and after participating in the e-workshop. Results: The 29 experts expressed their satisfaction on the potential of the software to address local specific needs when evaluating the main structure of the software, the stepwise approach for data collection and standardisation concept. Nevertheless, additional information to better describe local foods and recipes, as well as particular culinary patterns (e.g. mortar pounding), were proposed. Furthermore, food quantification in shared-plates and -bowls eating situations and interviewing of populations with low literacy skills, especially in rural settings, were acknowledged as requiring further specific considerations and appropriate solutions. Conclusions: An overall positive evaluation of the GloboDiet methodology by both African and international experts, supports the flexibility and potential applicability of this tool in diverse African settings and sets a positive platform for improved dietary monitoring and surveillance. Following this evaluation, prerequisite for future implementation and/or adaptation of GloboDiet in Africa, rigorous and robust capacity building as well as knowledge transfer will be required to roadmap a stepwise approach to implement this methodology across pilot African countries/regions.

Treatment decisions and mortality in HIV-positive presumptive smear-negative TB in the Xpert (TM) MTB/RIF era: a cohort study	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						Empirical treatment; Molecular diagnostic techniques/methods; Tuberculosis; pulmonary/diagnosis; Tuberculosis; pulmonary/epidemiology; HIV Infections/complications	ROLL-OUT; TUBERCULOSIS; IMPLEMENTATION; FEASIBILITY; MULTICENTER; DIAGNOSIS; ACCURACY; IMPACT	Background: The Xpert (TM) MTB/RIF (XP) has a higher sensitivity than sputum smear microscopy (70% versus 35%) for TB diagnosis and has been endorsed by the WHO for TB high burden countries to increase case finding among HIV co-infected presumptive TB patients. Its impact on the diagnosis of smear-negative TB in a routine care setting is unclear. We determined the change in diagnosis, treatment and mortality of smear-negative presumptive TB with routine use of Xpert MTB/RIF (XP). Methods: Prospective cohort study of HIV-positive smear-negative presumptive TB patients during a 12-month period after XP implementation in a well-staffed and trained integrated TB/HIV clinic in Kampala, Uganda. Prior to testing clinicians were asked to decide whether they would treat empirically prior to Xpert result; actual treatment was decided upon receipt of the XP result. We compared empirical and XP-informed treatment decisions and all-cause mortality in the first year. Results: Of 411 smear-negative presumptive TB patients, 175 (43%) received an XP; their baseline characteristics did not differ. XP positivity was similar in patients with a pre-XP empirical diagnosis and those without (9/29 [17%] versus 14/142 [10%], P = 0.23). Despite XP testing high levels of empirical treatment prevailed (18%), although XP results did change who ultimately was treated for TB. When adjusted for CD4 count, empirical treatment was not associated with higher mortality compared to no or microbiologically confirmed treatment. Conclusions: XP usage was lower than expected. The lower sensitivity of XP in smear-negative HIV-positive patients led experienced clinicians to use XP as a "rule-in" rather than "rule-out" test, with the majority of patients still treated empirically.

Transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in Households and the Community: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY			English	Review						contact tracing; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; recent transmission; systematic review; tuberculosis	RISK-FACTORS; SKIN-TEST; CALMETTE-GUERIN; HIGH-PREVALENCE; CLOSE CONTACTS; INFECTION; CHILDREN; AFRICA; CHILDHOOD; POPULATION	The individual-and population-level impact of household tuberculosis exposure on transmission is unclear but may have implications for the effectiveness and implementation of control interventions. We systematically searched for and included studies in which latent tuberculosis infection was assessed in 2 groups: children exposed and unexposed to a household member with tuberculosis. We also extracted data on the smear and culture status of index cases, the age and bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination status of contacts, and study design characteristics. Of 6,176 citations identified from our search strategy, 26 studies (13,999 children with household exposure to tuberculosis and 174,097 children without) from 1929-2015 met inclusion criteria. Exposed children were 3.79 (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.01, 4.78) times more likely to be infected than were their community counterparts. Metaregression demonstrated higher infection among children aged 0-4 years of age compared with children aged 10-14 years (ratio of odds ratios = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.43, 3.51) and among smear-positive versus smear-negative index cases (ratio of odds ratios = 5.45, 95% CI: 3.43, 8.64). At the population level, we estimated that a small proportion (<20%) of transmission was attributable to household exposure. Our results suggest that targeting tuberculosis prevention efforts to household contacts is highly effective. However, a large proportion of transmission at the population level may occur outside the household.

Aid relationships among actors at sub-national level represent a vital lever for health system development. This study was undertaken to assess the aid-effectiveness in post-conflict districts of northern Uganda. Method: This was a three district cross sectional study conducted from January to April 2013. A two stage snowball approach used to construct a relational-network for each district. Managers of organizations (ego) involved service delivery were interviewed and asked to list the external organizations (alters) that contribute to three key services. For each inter-organizational relationship (tie) a custom-made tool designed to reflect the aid-effectiveness in the Paris Declaration was used. Results: Three hundred eighty four relational ties between the organizations were generated from a total of 85 organizations interviewed. Satisfaction with aid relationships was mostly determined by 1) the extent ego was able to negotiate own priorities, 2) ego's awareness of expected results, and 3) provision of feedback about ego's performance. Respectively, the B coefficients were 16%, 38% and 19%. Disaggregated analysis show that satisfaction of fund-holders was also determined by addressing own priorities (30%), while provider satisfaction was mostly determined by awareness of expected results (66%) and feedback on performance (23%). All results were significant at p-value of 0.05. Overall, the regression models in these analyses accounted for 44% to 62% of the findings. Conclusion: Sub-national assessment of aid effectiveness is feasible with indicators adapted from the global parameters. These findings illustrate the focus on "results" domain and less on "ownership" and "resourcing" domains. The capacity and space for sub-national level authorities to negotiate local priorities requires more attention especially for health system development in post-conflict settings.

Prevalence and molecular characteristics of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin resistant strains, isolated from bulk can milk and raw milk products in pastoral communities of South-West Uganda	BMC INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article							ENTEROTOXIN GENES; VIRULENCE FACTORS; FOOD-PRODUCTS; MECA HOMOLOG; BOVINE; FRANCE; MEAT; PCR; TRANSMISSION; EVOLUTION	Background: Staphylococcus aureus strains are now regarded as zoonotic agents. In pastoral settings where human-animal interaction is intimate, multi-drug resistant microorganisms have become an emerging zoonotic issue of public health concern. The study of S. aureus prevalence, antimicrobial resistance and clonal lineages in humans, animals and food in African settings has great relevance, taking into consideration the high diversity of ethnicities, cultures and food habits that determine the lifestyle of the people. Little is known about milk carriage of methicillin resistant S. aureus strains (MRSA) and their virulence factors in Uganda. Here, we present the prevalence of MRSA in bulk can milk and raw milk products in pastoral communities of south-west Uganda. We also present PFGE profiles, spa-types, as well as frequency of enterotoxins genes. Methods: S. aureus was identified by the coagulase test, susceptibility testing by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion and E-test methods and MRSA by detection of the mecA gene and SCCmec types. The presence of Panton - Valentine Leucocidin (PVL) genes and staphylococcal enterotoxins was determined by PCR, while genotyping was by PFGE and spa typing. Results: S. aureus were isolated from 30/148 (20.3%) milk and 11/91(12%) sour milk samples. mecA gene carriage, hence MRSA, was detected in 23/41 (56.1%) of the isolates, with 21 of the 23 (91.3%) being SCCmec type V; while up to 30/41 (73.2%) of the isolates were resistant to tetracycline. Only five isolates carried the PVL virulence gene, while PFGE typing revealed ten clusters (ranging from two seven isolates each) that comprised 83% of the sample, and only eight isolates with unique pulsotypes. The largest PFGE profile (E) consisted of seven isolates while t7753, t1398, and t2112 were the most common spa-types. Thirty seven of the 41 strains (90.2%) showed at least one of the eight enterotoxin genes tested, with sem 29 (70.7%), sei 25 (61%) and seg 21 (51.2%) being the most frequently observed genes. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate MRSA and enterotoxin genes in raw milk and its products in Uganda. The fact that over 90% of the isolates carried at least one gene encoding enterotoxins shows a high risk of spread of foodborne diseases through milk in this setting.

COAT Team; ORCAS Team	Neurocognitive function in HIV-infected persons with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia: a comparison of three prospective cohorts	BMC NEUROLOGY			English	Article						AIDS dementia complex; Neurocognitive disorders; Cryptococcal meningitis; HIV; Neuropsychological tests; Cryptococcus	SCALE CES-D; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; TEST-PERFORMANCE; MENINGITIS; INDIVIDUALS; OUTCOMES; IMPACT; UGANDA; ADULTS; IMPAIRMENT	Background: HIV-infected persons with detectable cryptococcal antigen (CrAg) in blood have increased morbidity and mortality compared with HIV-infected persons who are CrAg-negative. This study examined neurocognitive function among persons with asymptomatic cryptococcal antigenemia. Methods: Participants from three prospective HIV cohorts underwent neurocognitive testing at the time of antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation. Cohorts included persons with cryptococcal meningitis (N = 90), asymptomatic CrAg + (N = 87), and HIV-infected persons without central nervous system infection (N = 125). Z-scores for each neurocognitive test were calculated relative to an HIV-negative Ugandan population with a composite quantitative neurocognitive performance Z-score (QNPZ-8) created from eight tested domains. Neurocognitive function was measured pre-ART for all three cohorts and additionally after 4 weeks of ART (and 6 weeks of pre-emptive fluconazole) treatment among asymptomatic CrAg + participants. Results: Cryptococcal meningitis and asymptomatic CrAg + participants had lower median CD4 counts (17 and 26 cells/mu L, respectively) than the HIV-infected control cohort (233 cells/mu L) as well as lower Karnofsky performance status (60 and 70 vs. 90, respectively). The composite QNPZ-8 for asymptomatic CrAg + (-1.80 Z-score) fell between the cryptococcal meningitis cohort (-2.22 Z-score, P = 0.02) and HIV-infected controls (-1.36, P = 0.003). After four weeks of ART and six weeks of fluconazole, the asymptomatic CrAg + cohort neurocognitive performance improved (-1.0 Z-score, P < 0.001). Conclusion: Significant deficits in neurocognitive function were identified in asymptomatic CrAg + persons with advanced HIV/ AIDS even without signs or sequelae of meningitis. Neurocognitive function in this group improves over time after initiation of pre-emptive fluconazole treatment and ART, but short term adherence support may be necessary.

We characterized the HIV epidemic among Kampala female sex workers (FSW). Methods: We used respondent-driven sampling to sample FSW aged 15+ years who reported having sold sex to men in the preceding 30 days; collected data through audio-computer assisted self-interviews, and tested blood, vaginal and rectal swabs for HIV, syphilis, neisseria gonorrhea, chlamydia trachomatis, and trichomonas vaginalis. Results: A total of 942 FSW were enrolled from June 2008 through April 2009. The overall estimated HIV prevalence was 33% (95% confidence intervals [CI] 30%-37%) and among FSW 25 years or older was 44%. HIV infection is associated with low levels of schooling, having no other work, never having tested for HIV, self-reported genital ulcers or sores, and testing positive for neisseria gonorrhea or any sexually transmitted infections (STI). Two thirds (65%) of commercial sex acts reportedly were protected by condoms; one in five (19%) FSW reported having had anal sex. Gender-based violence was frequent; 34% reported having been raped and 24% reported having been beaten by clients in the preceding 30 days. Conclusions: One in three FSW in Kampala is HIV-infected, suggesting a severe HIV epidemic in this population. Intensified interventions are warranted to increase condom use, HIV testing, STI screening, as well as antiretroviral treatment and pre-exposure prophylaxis along with measures to overcome gender-based violence.

Treating tobacco dependence: guidance for primary care on life-saving interventions. Position statement of the IPCRG	NPJ PRIMARY CARE RESPIRATORY MEDICINE			English	Review							NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY; SMOKING-CESSATION; GENERAL-PRACTICE; CANNABIS USE; HEALTH; TUBERCULOSIS; VARENICLINE; MORTALITY; DISEASE; SMOKERS	Tobacco smoking is the world's leading cause of premature death and disability. Global targets to reduce premature deaths by 25% by 2025 will require a substantial increase in the number of smokers making a quit attempt, and a significant improvement in the success rates of those attempts in low, middle and high income countries. In many countries the only place where the majority of smokers can access support to quit is primary care. There is strong evidence of cost-effective interventions in primary care yet many opportunities to put these into practice are missed. This paper revises the approach proposed by the International Primary Care Respiratory Group published in 2008 in this journal to reflect important new evidence and the global variation in primary-care experience and knowledge of smoking cessation. Specific for primary care, that advocates for a holistic, bio-psycho-social approach to most problems, the starting point is to approach tobacco dependence as an eminently treatable condition. We offer a hierarchy of interventions depending on time and available resources. We present an equitable approach to behavioural and drug interventions. This includes an update to the evidence on behaviour change, gender difference, comparative information on numbers needed to treat, drug safety and availability of drugs, including the relatively cheap drug cytisine, and a summary of new approaches such as harm reduction. This paper also extends the guidance on special populations such as people with long-term conditions including tuberculosis, human immunodeficiency virus, cardiovascular disease and respiratory disease, pregnant women, children and adolescents, and people with serious mental illness. We use expert clinical opinion where the research evidence is insufficient or inconclusive. The paper describes trends in the use of waterpipes and cannabis smoking and offers guidance to primary-care clinicians on what to do faced with uncertain evidence. Throughout, it recognises that clinical decisions should be tailored to the individual's circumstances and attitudes and be influenced by the availability and affordability of drugs and specialist services. Finally it argues that the role of the International Primary Care Respiratory Group is to improve the confidence as well as the competence of primary care and, therefore, makes recommendations about clinical education and evaluation. We also advocate for an update to the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines to optimise each primary-care intervention. This International Primary Care Respiratory Group statement has been endorsed by the Member Organisations of World Organization of Family Doctors Europe.	[Van Schayck, O. C.

Materials & methods Participatory methods were used to design data collection tools. Questionnaires were administered to 204 CAHWs, 215 farmers and 7 District Veterinary Officers (DVOs) to collect quantitative data. Seven DVOs and 1 Non Government Organization (NGO) representative were interviewed as key informants and one focus group discussion was conducted with a farmer group in Nakapiripirit to collect qualitative data. Questionnaire data was analyzed using SPSS version 19. Key messages from interviews and the focus group discussion were recorded in a notebook and reported verbatim. Results 70% of the farmers revealed that CAHWs are the most readily available animal health care service providers in their respective villages. CAHWs were instrumental in treatment of sick animals, disease surveillance, control of external parasites, animal production, vaccination, reporting, animal identification, and performing minor surgeries. Regarding their overall performance 88.8%(191/215) of the farmers said they were impressed. The main challenges faced by the CAHWs were inadequate facilitation, lack of tools and equipments, unwillingness of government to integrate them into the formal extension system, poor information flow, limited technical capacity to diagnose diseases, unwillingness of farmers to pay for services and sustainability issues. Conclusions and recommendations CAHWs remain the main source of animal health care services in Karamoja region and their services are largely satisfactory. The technical deficits identified require continuous capacity building programs, close supervision and technical backstopping. For sustainability of animal health care services in the region continuous training and strategic deployment of para-professionals that are formally recognised by the traditional civil service to gradually replace CAHWs is recommended.

The capacity this with respect to biomass production, lipid yield and lipid content was evaluated. The influence of inoculum size, carbon sources, variations in glucose concentration, nitrogen sources, C/N ratio, pH, temperature, agitation, and aeration rate and incubation period were investigated. Inoculum size of 10% v/v, glucose as a carbon source at 50 g/L glucose, 0.50 g/L yeast extract and 0.31 g/L (NH4) 2SO4, C/N ratio of 120, pH 5.5, incubation temperature of 30 degrees C, 225 rpm, 0.2 as aeration ratio and 144 h of incubation were found to be optimum conditions for lipid production. Then the yeast was grown in a batch bioreactor by combining the different optimized parameters together. Under the optimized conditions, the yeast gave maximum biomass (15.34 +/- 1.47 g/L), lipid yield (8.60 +/- 0.81 g/L) and lipid content (56.06 +/- 1.70%). The dominant fatty acids exhibited in order of their relative abundance (% w/w), were oleic, palmitic, linoleic, stearic, linolenic and palmitoleic acids. The concentration of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids adds up 78.63 +/- 2.19%. This suggests that this strain could be used as a good feedstock for biodiesel production.

Health system governance is expected to impact critically upon the success or otherwise of this important initiative. The objective of the study was to explore the barriers, facilitators and potential strategies to promote good health system governance in relation to scale-up of mental health care in Ethiopia. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using in-depth interviews. Key informants were selected purposively from national and regional level policy-makers, planners and service developers (n = 7) and district health office administrators and facility heads (n = 10) from a district in southern Ethiopia where a demonstration project to integrate mental health into primary care is underway. Topic guide development and analysis of transcripts were guided by an established framework for assessing health system governance, adapted for the Ethiopian context. Results: From the perspective of respondents, particular strengths of health system governance in Ethiopia included the presence of high level government support, the existence of a National Mental Health Strategy and the focus on integration of mental health care into primary care to improve the responsiveness of the health system. However, both national and district level respondents expressed concerns about low baseline awareness about mental health care planning, the presence of stigmatising attitudes, the level of transparency about planning decisions, limited leadership for mental health, lack of co-ordination of mental health planning, unreliable supplies of medication, inadequate health management information system indicators for monitoring implementation, unsustainable models for specialist mental health professional involvement in supervision and mentoring of primary care staff, lack of community mobilisation for mental health and low levels of empowerment and knowledge undermining meaningful involvement of stakeholders in local mental health care planning. Conclusions: To support scale-up of mental health care in Ethiopia, there is a critical need to strengthen leadership and co-ordination at the national, regional, zonal and district levels, expand indicators for routine monitoring of mental healthcare, promote service user involvement and address widespread stigma and low mental health awareness.

"If my husband leaves me, I will go home and suffer, so better cling to him and hide this thing" : The influence of gender on Option B plus prevention of mother-to-child transmission participation in Malawi and Uganda	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; FOLLOW-UP; POSTPARTUM WOMEN; EASTERN UGANDA; SOUTH-AFRICA; PMTCT; DISCLOSURE; BARRIERS; REASONS	The role of gender in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) participation under Option B+ has not been adequately studied, but it is critical for reducing losses to follow-up. This study used qualitative methods to examine the interplay of gender and individual, interpersonal, health system, and community factors that contribute to PMTCT participation in Malawi and Uganda. We conducted in-depth interviews with women in PMTCT, women lost to follow-up, government health workers, and stakeholders at organizations supporting PMTCT as well as focus group discussions with men. We analyzed the data using thematic content analysis. We found many similarities in key themes across respondent groups and between the two countries. The main facilitators of PMTCT participation were knowledge of the health benefits of ART, social support, and self-efficacy. The main barriers were fear of HIV disclosure and stigma and lack of social support, male involvement, self-efficacy, and agency. Under Option B+, women learn about their HIV status and start lifelong ART on the same day, before they have a chance to talk to their husbands or families. Respondents explained that very few husbands accompanied their wives to the clinic, because they felt it was a female space and were worried that others would think their wives were controlling them. Many respondents said women fear disclosing, because they fear HIV stigma as well as the risk of divorce and loss of economic support. If women do not disclose, it is difficult for them to participate in PMTCT in secret. If they do disclose, they must abide by their husbands' decisions about their PMTCT participation, and some husbands are unsupportive or actively discouraging. To improve PMTCT participation, Ministries of Health should use evidence- based strategies to address HIV stigma, challenges related to disclosure, insufficient social support and male involvement, and underlying gender inequality.

UNAIDS has set global targets to diagnose 90% of HIV-positive individuals, treat 90% of diagnosed individuals with ART, and suppress viral replication among 90% of treated individuals, for a population-level target of 73% of all HIV-positive persons with HIV viral suppression. OBJECTIVE To describe changes in the proportions of HIV-positive individuals with HIV viral suppression, HIV-positive individuals who had received a diagnosis, diagnosed individuals treated with ART, and treated individuals with HIV viral suppression, following implementation of a community-based testing and treatment program in rural East Africa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Observational analysis based on interim data from 16 rural Kenyan (n = 6) and Ugandan (n = 10) intervention communities in the SEARCH Study, an ongoing cluster randomized trial. Community residents who were 15 years or older (N = 77 774) were followed up for 2 years (2013-2014 to 2015-2016). HIV serostatus and plasma HIV RNA level were measured annually at multidisease health campaigns followed by home-based testing for nonattendees. All HIV-positive individuals were offered ART using a streamlined delivery model designed to reduce structural barriers, improve patient-clinician relationships, and enhance patient knowledge and attitudes about HIV. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Primary outcome was viral suppression (plasma HIV RNA <500 copies/mL) among all HIV-positive individuals, assessed at baseline and after 1 and 2 years. Secondary outcomes included HIV diagnosis, ART among previously diagnosed individuals, and viral suppression among those who had initiated ART. RESULTS Among 77 774 residents (male, 45.3%; age 15-24 years, 35.1%), baseline HIV prevalence was 10.3%(7108 of 69 283 residents). The proportion of HIV-positive individuals with HIV viral suppression at baseline was 44.7%(95% CI, 43.5%-45.9%; 3464 of 7745 residents) and after 2 years of intervention was 80.2%(95% CI, 79.1%-81.2%; 5666 of 7068 residents), an increase of 35.5 percentage points (95% CI, 34.4-36.6). After 2 years, 95.9% of HIV-positive individuals had been previously diagnosed (95% CI, 95.3%-96.5%; 6780 of 7068 residents); 93.4% of those previously diagnosed had received ART (95% CI, 92.8%-94.0%; 6334 of 6780 residents); and 89.5% of those treated had achieved HIV viral suppression (95% CI, 88.6%-90.3%; 5666 of 6334 residents). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among individuals with HIV in rural Kenya and Uganda, implementation of community-based testing and treatment was associated with an increased proportion of HIV-positive adults who achieved viral suppression, along with increased HIV diagnosis and initiation of antiretroviral therapy. In these communities, the UNAIDS population-level viral suppression target was exceeded within 2 years after program implementation.

This study evaluates cases of registered pesticide poisonings treated in selected rural (N = 101) and urban (N = 212) health facilities in Uganda from January 2010 to August 2016. In the urban setting, pesticides were the most prevalent single poison responsible for intoxications (N = 212 [28.8%]). Self-harm constituted a significantly higher proportion of the total number of poisonings in urban (63.3%) compared with rural areas (25.6%) where unintentional poisonings prevailed. Men were older than women and represented a majority of around 60% of the cases in both the urban and rural settings. Unintentional cases were almost the only ones seen below the age of 10, whereas self-harm dominated among adolescents and young persons from 10 to 29 years of age. Organophosphorus insecticides accounted for 73.0% of the poisonings. Urban hospitals provided a more intensive treatment and had registered fever complications than rural health care settings. To minimize self-harm with pesticides, a restriction of pesticide availability as shown to be effective in other low-income countries is recommended. Training of health care workers in proper diagnosis and treatment of poisonings and improved equipment in the health care settings should be strengthened.

This intervention's effectiveness is dependent on community adoption and changes in care-seeking practices. We assessed the implementation process of a theory-driven community dialogue (CD) intervention specifically designed to strengthen the support and uptake of the newly introduced iCCM services and related behaviours in three African countries. Methods: A qualitative process evaluation methodology was chosen and used secondary project data and primary data collected in two districts of each of the three countries, in purposefully sampled communities. The final data set included 67 focus group discussions and 57 key informant interviews, totalling 642 respondents, including caregivers, CD facilitators community leaders, and trainers. Thematic analysis of the data followed the 'Framework Approach' utilising both a deduction and induction process. Results: Results show that CDs contribute to triggering community uptake of and support for iCCM services through filling health information gaps and building cooperation within communities. We found it to be an effective approach for addressing social norms around child care practices. This approach was embraced by communities for its flexibility and value in planning individual and collective change. Conclusions: Regular CDs can contribute to the formation of new habits, particularly in relation to seeking timely care in case of child sickness. This study also confirms the value of process evaluation to unwrap the mechanisms of community mobilisation approaches in context and provides key insights for improving the CD approach.

Design/methodology: This study is cross-sectional and correlational. This study utilizes multiple regression models based on a sample of 52 government hospitals. The study's unit of inquiry is hospital directors and accountants. Findings: The correlation results indicate a significant positive relationship between managerial competencies and accountability. The study further finds that board governance is not significantly correlated with accountability of government hospitals. In terms of hospital governance dimensions; board composition is positively and significantly related with accountability unlike board structure and board independence. Research limitations/implications: The measurements used in all the predictor variables may not perfectly represent all the dimensions although they have been defined as precisely as possible by drawing upon relevant literature. Therefore, further research on other factors that explain the variance in accountability in the health sector is needed. Originality/value: In this paper, we provide the effects of hospital board governance and managerial competencies on accountability in a single study. In this study, managerial competency has a higher authority in explaining accountability than board governance. The findings have important insinuations for effective accountability in the health sector.

Methods: Self-reports and clinical records were used to assess the proportion achieving each stage in the cascade. Statistical inference based on a chi(2) test for categorical variables and modified Poisson regression were used to estimate prevalence risk ratios (PRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for enrolment into care and initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART). Results: From September 2013 through December 2015, 3,666 HIV-positive participants were identified in the RCCS. As of December 2015, 98% had received HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT), 74% were enrolled in HIV care, and 63% had initiated ART of whom 92% were virally suppressed after 12 months on ART. Engagement in care was lower among men than women (enrolment in care: adjPRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.77-0.91; ART initiation: adjPRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.69-0.82), persons aged 15-24 compared to those aged 30-39 (enrolment: adjPRR 0.72, 95% CI 0.63-0.82; ART: adjPRR 0.69, 95% CI 0.60-0.80), unmarried persons (enrolment: adjPRR 0.84, 95% CI 0.71-0.99; ART adjPRR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.95), and new in-migrants (enrolment: adjPRR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67-0.83; ART: adjPRR 0.76, 95% CI 0.67-0.85). This cohort achieved 98-65-92 towards the UNAIDS "90-90-90" targets with an estimated 58% of the entire HIV-positive RCCS population virally suppressed. Conclusions: This cohort achieved over 90% in both HCT and viral suppression among ART users, but only 65% in initiating ART, likely due to both an ART eligibility criterion of <500 CD4 cells/mL and suboptimal entry into care among men, younger individuals, and in-migrants. Interventions are needed to promote enrolment in HIV care, particular for hard-to-reach subpopulations.

To sustain its partial protective benefit, it is important that perceived reduced HIV risk does not lead to behavioural risk compensation among circumcised men and their sexual partners. This study explored beliefs that may influence post circumcision sexual behaviours among circumcised men in a programme setting. Methods: Forty-eight in-depth interviews were conducted with newly circumcised men in Wakiso district, central Uganda. Twenty-five men seeking circumcision services at public health facilities in the district were recruited from May to June 2015 and, interviewed at baseline and after 6 months. Participants' beliefs and sexual behaviours were compared just after circumcision and at follow up to explore changes. Data were managed using atlas. ti7 and analysed following a thematic network analysis framework. Results: Four themes following safe male circumcision emerged from this study. Beliefs related to: (1) sexual cleansing, (2) healing, (3) post SMC sexual capabilities and (4) continued HIV transmission risk. Most men maintained or adopted safer sexual behaviour; being faithful to their partner after circumcision or using condoms with extramarital partners following the knowledge that there was continued HIV risk post circumcision. The most prevalent risky belief was regarding sexual cleansing post circumcision, and as a result of this belief, some men had one off condom-less sexual intercourse with a casual partner. Some resumed sex before the recommended period due to misunderstanding of what comprised healing. Conclusions: Although most men maintained or adopted safer sexual behaviour, there were instances of risky sexual behaviour resulting from beliefs regarding the first sexual intercourse after circumcision or misunderstandings of what comprised wound healing. If not addressed, these may attenuate the safe male circumcision benefits of risk reduction for HIV.

However, there is limited understanding of health system barriers to utilization and delivery of appropriate, highimpact, and cost-effective interventions at the point of service delivery in districts and sub-districts in low-income countries. In this study we illustrate the use of the bottleneck analysis approach, which could be used to identify bottlenecks in service delivery within the district health system. Methods: A modified Tanahashi model with six determinants for effective coverage was used to determine bottlenecks in service provision for maternal and newborn care. The following interventions provided during antenatal care were used as tracer interventions: use of iron and folic acid, intermittent presumptive treatment for malaria, HIV counseling and testing, and syphilis testing. Data from cross-sectional household and health facility surveys in Mayuge and Namayingo districts in Uganda were used in this study. Results: Effective coverage and human resource gaps were identified as the biggest bottlenecks in both districts, with coverage ranging from 0% to 66% for effective coverage and from 46% to 58% for availability of health facility staff. Our findings revealed a similar pattern in bottlenecks in both districts for particular interventions although the districts are functionally independent. Conclusion: The modified Tanahashi model is an analysis tool that can be used to identify bottlenecks to effective coverage within the district health system, for instance, the effective coverage for maternal and newborn care interventions. However, the analysis is highly dependent on the availability of data to populate all six determinants and could benefit from further validation analysis for the causes of bottlenecks identified.

This study compared the HPV-vaccinated and non-vaccinated young women in Uganda regarding cervical cancer risk perceptions, high-risk sexual behaviors, syphilis and HIV infections 5 years after vaccine implementation. Methods: This was a population-based comparative cross-sectional survey conducted in Uganda. The 438 participants were sexually active young women aged 15-24 years and mean age was 18.6 (SD 1.4). The majority (53.0%) were HPV-vaccinated in 2008 without assessment of sexual activity prior to HPV vaccination. Upon verbal assessment of sexual activity at the time of follow-up, data were collected using a questionnaire and laboratory testing of blood samples for syphilis and HIV infections. Results: There were no significant differences between the HPV-vaccinated and non-vaccinated groups regarding the prevalence of high-risk sexual behaviors, syphilis and HIV infections. Cervical cancer risk perceptions and age at sexual debut were nonetheless significantly lower among the vaccinated group compared to their non-vaccinated counterparts. However, HPV vaccination was not significantly associated to cervical cancer risk perceptions and early age at sexual debut in multivariate logistic regression analysis. Conclusions: We found no associations between HPV vaccination, cervical cancer risk perceptions, high-risk sexual behaviors, syphilis and HIV infections among young women in Uganda 5 years after vaccine implementation. Young girls in the study population were found to be sexually active at a young age, affirming the importance of targeting girls of younger age for HPV vaccination.

We searched the following databases Web of Science, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PsychINFO, Global Health, CINAHL and African Journals Online using a combination of key words: heart failure or congestive heart failure or cardiac failure. We limited our search to studies conducted in SSA and articles published 2000-2014. Twenty-seven articles met our inclusion criteria and all were quantitative studies.

Farmers' Perceptions of Rice Postharvest Losses in Eastern Uganda	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION			English	Article						Smallholder farmer in Uganda; rice postharvest losses	NIGERIA; ADOPTION; AFRICA	The cross-sectional survey involving 83 farmers in focus group discussions and 150 individual interviews examined smallholder farmers' perceptions about postharvest losses (PHLs) in in rice in Eastern Uganda. Principal component analysis and logistic regression were used to establish the determinants of farmers' perceived ability to reduce PHLs. Farmers perceive 66% of the losses occurred in the field-based activities of harvesting, heaping and threshing through spillage, while 34% occurred in the home-based activities of drying and storage. Quality deterioration was perceived to be highest at harvesting and drying stages. Farmers' perceived themselves least able to to reduce PHLs at the stages where the losses were highest. These perceptions are significantly influenced farm size, awareness of the modes through which losses occur, proportions of rice sold and household characteristics. Interventions to reduce PHLs should intensify awareness and mindset change, commercialization of rice production, best-fit practices and technologies foe smallholder farmers and collective action for groups of farmers to undertake some operations together.

Plasmodium falciparum Histidine-Rich Protein-2 Plasma Concentrations Are Higher in Retinopathy-Negative Cerebral Malaria Than in Severe Malarial Anemia	OPEN FORUM INFECTIOUS DISEASES			English	Article						cerebral; malaria; PfHRP2; retinopathy; severe	SEQUESTRATION; CHILDREN; RELEASE	Background. Malaria retinopathy has been proposed as marker of "true" cerebral malaria (CM), ie, coma due to Plasmodium falciparum vs coma due to other causes, with incidental P falciparum parasitemia. Plasma P falciparum histidine-rich protein-2 (PfHRP2) concentrations distinguish retinopathy-positive (RP) from retinopathy-negative (RN) CM but have not been compared between RN CM and other forms of severe malaria or asymptomatic parasitemia (AP). Methods. We compared plasma PfHRP2 concentrations in 260 children with CM (247 examined for retinopathy), 228 children with severe malarial anemia (SMA), and 30 community children with AP. Results. Plasmodium falciparum HRP2 concentrations were higher in children with RP CM than RN CM (P = .006), with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.61 (95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.68). Plasmodium falciparum HRP2 concentrations and sequestered parasite biomass were higher in RN CM than SMA (both P < .03) or AP (both P < .001). Conclusions. Plasmodium falciparum HRP2 concentrations are higher in children with RN CM than in children with SMA or AP, suggesting that P falciparum is involved in disease pathogenesis in children with CM. Plasmodium falciparum HRP2 concentrations may provide a more feasible and consistent assessment of the contribution of P falciparum to severe disease than malaria retinopathy.

Cryptococcus is the most common etiology of adult meningitis in Africa. Amphotericin B deoxycholate remains paramount to treatment, despite toxicities, including acute kidney injury (AKI). We assessed the ability of the following urine markers to predict AKI in patients who received amphotericin B: urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), cystatin C (CysC), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), and protein. Methods. One hundred and thirty human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected participants with cryptococcal meningitis were enrolled and received amphotericin and fluconazole for 2 weeks. We defined AKI as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m(2); measured urine NGAL, CysC, TIMP-2, and protein; and explored AKI incidence, risk factors, and associations with mortality using Cox proportional hazards models. Results. Participants were 48% female with a median age of 35 years, a median CD4 count of 21 cells/mu L, and 44% died within 12 months. Incident AKI occurred in 42% and was associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.8; P < .001). Development of AKI was associated with female sex (P = .04) and with higher CD4 count (49 vs 14 cells/mu L; P < .01). Urine protein level in the highest quartile independently predicted AKI and mortality (aHR = 1.64, P = .04; aHR = 2.13, P = .02, respectively). Urine NGAL levels in the highest quartile independently predicted AKI (aHR = 1.65; P = .04). Conclusions. Acute kidney injury occurred in 42% of patients, and AKI was associated with mortality. Urine biomarkers, specifically urine protein, may be useful for antecedent prediction of amphotericin-associated AKI but need further evaluation.

Unfortunately, pharmaceuticals have left their industrial and household confines and leaked into the environment. Pharmaceuticals are now major environmental pollutants, and are ubiquitous in waters and soils. Unlike other environmental contaminants, pharmaceutical pollutants are not yet regulated globally, simply because acute risk assessments show insignificant human health hazard. But the pitfalls of pharmaceutical pollutants extend beyond acute effects to delayed effects from bioaccumulation, amplified effects from drug-drug interactions, exacerbation of drug resistance, and reduction in aquatic and terrestrial food production. Therefore, ignoring pharmaceutical pollutants deprives society of holistic public health protection.

Methods A 3.5-year program was implemented in 12 government hospitals, three each in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda and Zambia. A four-pillared approach of advocacy, staff training, service delivery strengthening and international and regional partnership working was utilized. A baseline assessment was undertaken to ascertain needs, and 27 indicators were agreed to guide and evaluate the intervention. Data were also collected through surveys, interviews and focus groups. Results Palliative care was integrated into all 12 hospital settings to various degrees through concurrent interventions of these four approaches. Overall, 218 advocacy activities were undertaken and 4153 community members attended awareness training. 781 staff were equipped with the skills and resources to cascade palliative care through their hospitals and into the community. Patients identified for palliative care increased by a factor of 2.7. All 12 hospitals had oral morphine available and consumption increased by a factor of 2.4 over two years. Twenty-two UK mentors contributed 750 volunteer days to support colleagues in each hospital transfer knowledge and skills. Conclusions Integration of palliative care within different government health services in Africa can be achieved through agreed interventions being delivered concurrently. These include advocacy at Ministry, Provincial and District level, intensive and wide-ranging training, clinical and support services supported by resources, including essential medicines, and an investment in partnerships between hospital, district and community.

Design A qualitative study using focus group discussions and key informant interviews. Setting Discussions and interviews carried out in the community within two districts in Eastern Uganda. Participants Ten (10) focus group discussions with 119 screening-eligible women aged between 25 and 49 years and 11 key informant interviews with healthcare providers and administrators. Results Study participants' knowledge about cervical cancer causes, signs and symptoms, testing methods and prevention was poor. Many participants attributed the cause of cervical cancer to use of contraception while key informants said that some believed it was due to witchcraft. Perceptions towards cervical cancer and screening were majorly positive with many participants stating that they were at risk of getting cervical cancer. The facilitators to accessing cervical cancer screening were: experiencing signs and symptoms of cervical cancer, family history of the disease and awareness of the disease/screening service. Lack of knowledge about cervical cancer and screening, health system challenges, fear of test outcome and consequences and financial constraints were barriers to cervical cancer screening. Conclusion Whereas perceptions towards cervical cancer and screening were positive, knowledge of study participants on cervical cancer was poor. To improve cervical cancer screening, effort should be focused on reducing identified barriers and enhancing facilitators.

This paper describes a conceptual framework-the partnership framework-and analytic approach for evaluating the perceptions of partnerships' added value as well as the results from an application to one case in Uganda. Methods: We used a mixed-methods case study design embedded in the Gavi Full Country Evaluations (FCE) to test the partnership framework on Uganda's human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine application partnership. Data from document review, interviews, and social network surveys enabled the testing of the relationships between partnership framework domains (context, structure, practices, performance, and outcomes). Topic guides were based on the framework domains and network surveys identified working together relationships, professional trust, and perceptions of the effectiveness, efficiency, and legitimacy of the partnership's role in this process. Results: Data from seven in-depth interviews, 11 network surveys and document review were analyzed according to the partnership framework, confirming relationships between the framework domains. Trust was an important contributor to the perceived effectiveness of the process. The network was structured around the EPI program, who was considered the leader of this process. While the structure and composition of the network was largely viewed as supporting an effective and legitimate process, the absence of the Ministry of Education (MoE) may have had downstream consequences if this study's results had not been shared with the Ministry of Health (MoH) and acted upon. The partnership was not perceived to have increased the efficiency of the process, perhaps as a result of unclear or absent guidelines around roles and responsibilities. Conclusion: The health and functioning of global health partnerships can be evaluated using the framework and approach presented here. Network theory and methods added value to the conceptual and analytic processes and we recommend applying this approach to other global health partnerships to ensure that they are meeting the complex challenges they were designed to address.

Epidemiology and Characteristics of Neurosurgical Conditions at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital	WORLD NEUROSURGERY			English	Article						Africa; Epidemiology; Global surgery; Neurosurgery; Uganda	TRAUMATIC BRAIN-INJURY; UGANDA; CARE; CHALLENGES; COUNTRIES; SURGERY	BACKGROUND: The unmet surgical need, specifically neurosurgical need, in Uganda is significant, yet only 2 public hospitals currently perform neurosurgery in the country. This study examines the epidemiology and outcomes of neurosurgical conditions presenting to 1 of 12 regional referral hospitals in Uganda, in an effort to understand the neurosurgical needs of this population. METHODS: The study was conducted at Mbarara Regional Referral Hospital (MRRH), in southwestern Uganda. Demographics, clinical characteristics, and outcomes were retrospectively collected for all patients who presented to MRRH with a neurosurgical condition between January 2012 and September 2015. RESULTS: During the study period, 1854 patients presented to MRRH with a neurosurgical condition. More than half of the patients were between 19 and 40 years old, and the majority were males (76.1%). The overall median length of stay was 5 days (interquartile range: 2.5-10). The majority of admissions were due to trauma (87%), with almost 60% due to road traffic incidents. The overall mortality rate was 12.8%. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model revealed that age, closed head injury, and admission Glasgow Coma Scale have a strong positive correlation with mortality while getting a diagnostic image and neurosurgical procedure were negatively correlated with mortality. CONCLUSION: Traumatic brain injury represented the majority of neurosurgical admissions at MRRH, disproportionately affecting young males. Age, closed head injury, admission Glasgow Coma Scale, getting a diagnostic image, and neurosurgical procedure were all independent predictors of mortality. Resource appropriate interventions throughout the health system are needed to meet the demand and improve outcomes.

In this exploratory study, we use cross-sectional data to examine the relative effects of acculturation inclinations on self-rated health statuses among migrants in a poor, urban neighborhood in Accra. Much emphasis is placed on the role of the urban environment in disease outbreaks within the city, the patterns of communicable and non-communicable diseases, spatial health inequalities, and the distribution of sexual and reproductive illness risks in Accra. However, the ways by which acculturation inclinations and dimensions may exert positive or negative influence on health outcomes in such contexts have not been examined. We developed proxies for four main acculturation elements: assimilation, separation, integration, and marginalization. We used results from a semi-structured survey questionnaire with 296 migrants. After controlling for socio-demographic characteristics and social capital, findings from Ordinal Logistic Regression models indicate that the acculturation predictors of subjective health status are assimilation and marginalization. This study is the first step in understanding the possible trajectories by which acculturation affects health in the internal migration context in Ghana.

But this approach has never before been tried in Sub-Saharan Africa. Reflecting on the first two applications in Uganda, we apply the same criteria for success commonly used for such projects in the most advanced countries. Can this approach work successfully with samples of a public low in literacy and education? Can it work on some of the critical policy choices faced by the public in rural Uganda? This essay reflects on quantitative and qualitative results from Uganda's first Deliberative Polls. We find that the projects were representative in both attitudes and demographics. They produced substantial opinion change supported by identifiable reasons. They avoided distortions from inequality and polarization. They produced actionable results that can be expected to influence policy on difficult choices.

Methods We updated previous meta-analyses of published cluster randomized trials of community-based interventions for neonatal survival. For each study we extracted baseline data on the context: geographical area; available facilities and staffing; immediate breastfeeding and facility births; and neonatal mortality. We also extracted data on the primary outcome (neonatal survival) and intermediate outcomes of the interventions (changes in immediate breastfeeding and facility births). We used forest plots and pooled sub-group analysis to seek patterns in associations between the effect size and the context or type of intervention (home-based counselling or women's groups). Findings We included 17 trials, spanning years from 2001 to 2013. A 25% reduction in neonatal mortality (relative risk, RR: 0.75; 95% confidence interval, Of 0.69-0.80) was found when pooling six studies in settings with 44 or more deaths per 1000 live births. In lower mortality settings (pooling six studies with 32 or fewer deaths per 1000 live births) there was no evidence of an effect. We observed some evidence that community approaches had a stronger effect in south Asia than in sub-Saharan Africa. Community approaches had a lower impact on neonatal mortality in settings where at least 44% of women delivered in a facility. Conclusion As neonatal mortality declined, the impact of community approaches on survival appeared to be lower, and the role of these approaches in supporting newborn care in weak health systems may need to be re-examined.

Contraceptive Use and Pregnancy Incidence Among Women Participating in an HIV Prevention Trial	JOURNAL OF WOMENS HEALTH			English	Article						hormonal contraception; contraceptive initiation; DMPA; oral contraception; Uganda; HIV prevention	PREEXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS; INFECTION; OUTCOMES; GEL	Background: Recent HIV prevention trials required use of effective contraceptive methods to fulfill eligibility for enrollment. We compared pregnancy rates in a subset of participants enrolled in the Microbicide Trials Network protocol (MTN-003), a randomized trial of chemoprophylaxis to prevent HIV acquisition among women aged 18-45 years who initiated depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) or combined oral contraceptives (COCs) at enrollment, relative to those already using DMPA or COCs. Methods: Data were analyzed from MTN-003 participants from Uganda. Before enrollment, information on contraceptive type and initiation date was obtained. Urine pregnancy tests were performed at monthly follow-up visits. Cox proportional hazards models were used to compare pregnancy incidence among new users (initiated <= 60 days before enrollment) and established users (initiated >60 days before enrollment). Results: Of 322 women enrolled, 296 were COC or DMPA users, 82 (28%) were new users, and 214 (72%) were established users. Pregnancy incidence was higher among new contraceptive users compared to established users (20.70% vs. 10.55%; adjusted hazard ratio [HR] = 1.66; 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.93-2.96). Among DMPA users, pregnancy incidence was 10.20% in new users versus 3.48% in established users (HR= 2.56; 95% CI 0.86-7.65). Among new COC users, pregnancy incidence was 42.67% in new users versus 23.67% in established COC users (adjusted HR= 1.74; 95% CI 0.87-3.48). Conclusions: New contraceptive users, regardless of method, at the Uganda MTN-003 site had an increased pregnancy risk compared to established users, which may be due to contraceptive initiation primarily for trial eligibility.

In urban sub-Saharan Africa, energy-producing resource recovery has the potential to generate greater revenue than use as soil conditioner. In contrast with wastewater sludge, the technical feasibility of using dried FS as solid fuel in industries has not been investigated. This study evaluated it through characterization of dried FS from drying beds and by assessing the combustion performance in two pilot-scale kilns, in Kampala and Dakar. Results from the fuel characterization demonstrate that dried FS had comparable fuel characteristics as wastewater sludge considering calorific value and ash content. The calorific values and ash contents were 10.9-13.4 MJ/kg dry matter (DM) and 47.0-58.7%, respectively. Results from pilot-scale experiments suggest that dried FS can be effective in providing energy for industries. Temperatures in pilot-scale kilns fueled by FS were 800 degrees C, sufficient for curing of clay bricks, and 437 degrees C, sufficient for waste oil regeneration. In Kampala and Dakar, an estimated 20,000 tons of FS DM per year accumulate. Tapping the industrial fuel market and financial benefits could be realized through optimization of onsite sanitation and treatment technologies.

An improved understanding of the pervasive environmental extent of agro-chemical contaminants is critical to the success of beekeeping development and the production of clean hive products. This study developed and validated a multi-residue method for screening 36 pesticides in honeybees, honey and beeswax using LC-MS/MS and GC-ECD. Of the 36 screened pesticides, 20 were detected. The highest frequencies occurred in beeswax and in samples from apiaries located in the proximity of citrus and tobacco farms. Fungicides were the most prevalent chemical class. Detected insecticides included neonicotinoids, organophosphates, carbamates, organophosphorus, tetrazines and diacylhydrazines. All detected pesticide levels were below maximum residue limits (according to EU regulations) and the lethal doses known for honeybees. However, future risk assessment is needed to determine the health effects on the African genotype of honeybees by these pesticide classes and combinations of these. In conclusion, our data present a significant challenge to the burgeoning organic honey sector in Uganda, but to achieve this, there is an urgent need to regulate the contact routes of pesticides into the beehive products. Interestingly, the "zero" detection rate of pesticides in the Mid-Northern zone is a significant indicator of the large potential to promote Ugandan organic honey for the export market.

In this article, we draw from a qualitative study of HIV treatment seeking to examine the drug-taking routines and health-related subjectivities of men and women on antiretroviral treatment (ART) at two sites in Uganda. We show that while not all participants in ART programs understand clinical protocols in biomedical terms, they adopt treatment-taking strategies to integrate medication into daily practices and social spaces. In turn, these embedded practices and understandings shape long-term hopes and fears for living with HIV, including the possibility of a cure. More significant than new forms of citizenship or sociality, we suggest that quotidian dimensions of treatment normalization shape the long-term experience of medication and outlook for the future.

ARROW Trial Team	Virologic Response to First-line Efavirenz-or Nevirapine-based Antiretroviral Therapy in HIV-infected African Children	PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE JOURNAL			English	Article						HIV; children; antiretroviral therapy; viral load; NNRTI	THAI CHILDREN; FAILURE; REGIMENS; ADOLESCENTS; PREDICTORS; MODELS; TIME	Background: Poorer virologic response to nevirapine- versus efavirenz-based antiretroviral therapy (ART) has been reported in adult systematic reviews and pediatric studies. Methods: We compared drug discontinuation and viral load (VL) response in ART-naive Ugandan/Zimbabwean children >= 3 years of age initiating ART with clinician-chosen nevirapine versus efavirenz in the ARROW trial. Predictors of suppression <80, <400 and <1000 copies/mL at 36, 48 and 144 weeks were identified using multivariable logistic regression with backwards elimination (P = 0.1). Results: A total of 445 (53%) children received efavirenz and 391 (47%) nevirapine. Children receiving efavirenz were older (median age, 8.6 vs. 7.5 years nevirapine, P < 0.001) and had higher CD4% (12% vs. 10%, P = 0.05), but similar pre-ART VL (P = 0.17). The initial non-nucleoside-reverse-transcriptase-inhibitor (NNRTI) was permanently discontinued for adverse events in 7 of 445 (2%) children initiating efavirenz versus 9 of 391 (2%) initiating nevirapine (P = 0.46); at switch to second line in 17 versus 23, for tuberculosis in 0 versus 26, for pregnancy in 6 versus 0 and for other reasons in 15 versus 5. Early (36-48 weeks) virologic suppression <80 copies/mL was superior with efavirenz, particularly in children with higher pre-ART VL (P = 0.0004); longer-term suppression was superior with nevirapine in older children (P = 0.05). Early suppression was poorer in the youngest and oldest children, regardless of NNRTI (P = 0.02); longer-term suppression was poorer in those with higher pre-ART VL regardless of NNRTI (P = 0.05). Results were broadly similar for <400 and <1000 copies/mL. Conclusion: Short-term VL suppression favored efavirenz, but long-term relative performance was age dependent, with better suppression in older children with nevirapine, supporting World Health Organization recommendation that nevirapine remains an alternative NNRTI.

We aimed to assess factors associated with peer violence victimization among primary school children in Uganda. We conducted multilevel multivariable logistic regression analyses of cross-sectional data from 3706 primary students in 42 Ugandan primary schools. Among primary school students, 29% and 34% had ever experienced physical and emotional violence perpetrated by their peers, respectively. Factors strongly associated with both physical and emotional violence were similar and overlapping, and included exposure to interparental violence, having an attitude supportive of violence against children from school staff, not living with biological parents, working for payment, and higher SDQ score. However, we found that younger age, sharing sleeping area with an adult and achieving a higher educational performance score, were specifically associated with physical violence. On the other hand, being female, walking to school, reporting disability and eating one meal on the previous day, were particularly associated with emotional violence. Interventions to reduce peer violence should focus on family contexts, school environments and those with poor socio-economic status may need extra support.
